I don't know about your Mom, but my Mom always amazes me. Those of you who know
me or follow my blogs know that about a year ago I bought a house and the
backyard had two brick benches on the patio. The one thing they were missing
was some nice bench covers. So, my Mom, being the amazing Mom that she is,
decided she was going to make me some. So my Mom & Aly went to the store and
picked brought back samples of outdoor fabrics and I picked one.

A few weeks later my Mom called me and asked for the measurements of the
benches and soon enough she brought me some amazing bench covers. Given that my
parents live in Virginia when she came to visit she didn't want to bring the
foam for the covers with her so she had it shipped to me. Two days ago I got
the foam and today I finally got around to finishing the cutting and
installation of the foam. After, I finished I tried them out and they look
amazing.

To check out some photos of them in their final state check them out
