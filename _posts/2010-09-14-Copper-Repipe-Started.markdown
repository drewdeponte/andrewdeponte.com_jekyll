Hey All, I know it has a been a while since I made a post on my progress with
the house. But, that is because I have been crazy busy with me new job and have
also been sick for a decent amount of that time. Anyways, my parents were
visiting from Virginia this past weekend so my Dad came over to my house and
helped me on Saturday and Sunday for bit with the copper repipe I recently
started. Prior to my Dad getting here I ran all the copper for the cold water
mainline in the attic up to the wall right before the new tankless water
heater.

On Saturday and Sunday my Dad and I finished running the cold through that
wall, connecting the cold to the tankless water heater, running the hot into
the attic, and wiring the electrical for the tankless and connecting it. This
leaves me with needing to finish running the hot mainline with the rest of the
valves in the attic and then doing room drops as necessary for the new laundry
room, kitchen, and bathroom. If you are interested in seeing you can checkout
