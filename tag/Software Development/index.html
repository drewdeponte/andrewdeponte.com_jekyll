    <p>I woke up early this morning and thought it was time for a little <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard'>sublime_guard</a> love. I went through and tackled all of the syntax highlighting issues. This included the following issues (<a href='https://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/27'>#27</a>, <a href='https://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/30'>#30</a>, <a href='https://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/31'>#31</a>, <a href='https://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/38'>#38</a>, <a href='https://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/43'>#43</a>, <a href='https://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/29'>#29</a>).</p>

<p>I also cleaned up a number of tickets that were lying around and had either been completed already or were tickets that were invalid.</p>

<p>I also started a branch for adding python3 support to the plugin. The branch is named <strong>python3_support</strong>. I would love it if anyone out there in the ether would grab that branch, test it out, and give me some feedback.</p>

<p>Anyways, I hope you guys enjoy the updates. As usual if you installed from Package Control just restart Sublime Text 2. If you installed manually then just pull the latest version down with Git.</p>

<p>See you all next time.</p>

  <section>
    <p>So when Mac OS X Mountain Lion was released a few days ago I jumped on upgrading and got switched over as soon as I could. My mentality for upgrading is that I would much rather deal with the pain of upgrading in smaller chunks when needed rather than waiting. Plus, I just like to be on the latest and greatest in terms of the tools I use for my job.</p>

<p>Anyways, below is going to be a listing of some of the hiccups that either I or other developers on my team have run into in terms of their Ruby and Rails development environment setups.</p>

<h2 id='git'>Git</h2>

<p>Some of the devs on my team had Git installed via the <a href='http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/'>git-osx-installer</a>. These developers seemed to lose their Git installs when they upgraded. I was using a <a href='http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/'>Homebrew</a> install of Git and it worked just fine for me after upgrading. So be aware of what your situation is and resort to brew because it is awesome.</p>

<h2 id='xcode_44'>XCode 4.4</h2>

<p>In order to build gems with the native exensions and just to have the basic development tools around I installed the latest XCode 4.4. Once installed I went to the preferences menu, in the download tab, and chose to install the <em>Command Line Tools</em> because that is really what I was looking for more than anything. I have read on other posts online that you can download the <em>Command Line Tools</em> alone and install just them. I personally chose to install XCode as I do use XCode and the native tools to work on iPhone/iPad app development as well.</p>

<h2 id='gcc42'>gcc-4.2</h2>

<p>The latest XCode now comes with clang/llvm which is a new C/C++/Objective-C compiler. The problem is that the Ruby language isn&#8217;t fully compatible with clang and llvm. Therefore, you need to install GCC 4.2 using Homebrew. GCC 4.2 is the latest version of the GCC compiler that apple provided before switching to clang/llvm. Anyways, you can install GCC 4.2 by doing the following with brew:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='bash'>brew tap homebrew/dupes
brew install apple-gcc42
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The above will install the apple gcc-4.2 in a side by side fashion with XCode. This means that it won&#8217;t mess up your existing XCode install like other solutions.</p>

<p>Once you install gcc-4.2 then you can install/reinstall your ruby version inside of RVM as needed.</p>

<h2 id='apache_2_web_sharing'>Apache 2 (Web Sharing)</h2>

<p>In the upgrade it seems that they have revamped the Sharing preference pane. In the process of this it seems that Apple has decided to remove the Web sharing component of this preference pane. Don&#8217;t worry though. Apache is still there and running. You just can&#8217;t start it and stop it from the preferences pane anymore. You can use the following commands instead.</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='bash'>sudo apachectl stop
sudo apachectl start
sudo apachectl restart
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When the upgrade happened it nuked all my <code>/etc/apache2/users/</code> configs and all my other apache configs. So, if you have any custom apache configs as I did you should probably back them up before upgrading.</p>

<h2 id='x11'>X11</h2>

<p>It seems that another thing that was changed with the upgrade to Mac OS X Mountain Lion was that they removed the X11 that I had previously installed and seemed to no longer provide it. Thats ok though because XQuartz 2.7.2 is what you want and it is available freely at <a href='http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/'>http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/</a>. Just install that bad boy and follow the on screen instructions to reboot when it is done and you should be good to go in terms of X11.</p>

<h2 id='imagemagick'>ImageMagick</h2>

<p>Before upgrading I had ImageMagick installed via Homebrew. After, the upgrade was finished my ImageMagick was exiting with failures about some dylib. To solve this problem I simply ran the following and I was back in running order with respect to ImageMagick:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='bash'>brew upgrade imagemagick
</code></pre>
</div>
<h2 id='pygments'>Pygments</h2>

<p>I use Pygments to handle syntax highlighting in my jekyll sites and it seemed to not be working after the upgrade. I believe this is because it is now using Python 2.7.2. To resolve this issue I just re-installed Pygments using the following:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='bash'>sudo easy_install Pygments
</code></pre>
</div>
    <div style="clear: both;"></div>

    <p>It has been a while since I have provided an update on my <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard'>Sublime Text 2 Guard Plugin</a> and I just made some changes so I figured I would make a quick post. The project has recently had a number of contributions which I will list in the changes below.</p>

</ul>

<p>I have been completely stoked with the growing usage of this plugin as well as the abundance of contributions people have been making to the plugin. In this update there are a number of people that need to be called out with special thanks.</p>

<p><a href='http://github.com/diogomafra'>@diogomafra</a> provided a <em>Clear output when predefined text found</em> feature. I am sure many users will find this feature a nice addition to smoothing out their workflow. Thank you for your contribution <a href='http://github.com/diogomafra'>@diogomafra</a>.</p>

<p><a href='http://github.com/chrislerum'>@chrislerum</a> provided <strong>rbenv support</strong>. I know that this feature will be huge for a number of the users as this was a highly requestd feature. Thank you so much for your contribution <a href='http://github.com/chrislerum'>@chrislerum</a>.</p>

<p><a href='http://github.com/brandonblack'>@brandonblack</a> provided the ability to function without bundler. This will allow users who aren&#8217;t using bundler to be able to use this plugin. I think this is a great addition as the more people we can get using this plugin the more feedback we can get. Hence, the better it will become. Thanks for your contribution <a href='http://github.com/brandonblack'>@brandonblack</a>.</p>

<p><a href='http://github.com/whitequark'>@whitequark</a> provided the basis for the <strong>Run all Tests &amp; Show Guard Output</strong> feature.

    <p>Well, I am back with some more updates on my <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard'>Sublime Text 2 Guard Plugin</a>. This is a smaller release than the last as I have been very busy. Despite its small stature it is an exciting one as we have another contribution to honor. The following are the recent updates:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed comma, single quote, question mark color issues (<a href='https://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/25'>#25</a>)</li>

<li>Fixed small color issue caused by <code>!</code> char (<a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/26'>#26</a>)</li>

<li>Better console colors, change <code>0 failures</code> from red to green (Thanks <a href='http://github.com/lidanh'>@lidanh</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>A special thanks goes out to <a href='http://github.com/lidanh'>@lidanh</a> for the code contribution. The new colors are much nicer and the <code>0 failures</code> being green instead of red makes it easier to detect success vs failure.</p>

<p>Thanks also goes out to all the users of the <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard'>Sublime Text 2 Guard Plugin</a>. Especially, the users that have been submitting bug reports and feature requests. This plugin wouldn&#8217;t exist without the direction and feedback from you all.</p>

<p>Please continue to provide feedback via Sublime Text 2 Guard Plugin <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues'>issues</a> on our GitHub page.</p>

    <p>Relatively recently I switched to ZSH for my shell. The primary reason I switched was that I had more flexibility in prompts as I can setup a right prompt and a left prompt. I also like the completion interfacing that ZSH provides. Anyways, I finally got around to generalizing my ZSH setup and makeing it available on GitHub as a backup for myself so that I can easily set it up again in the future, as well as a means of sharing my setup with all of you. Anyways, it is availabe on GitHub at <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/dotzsh'>http://github.com/cyphactor/dotzsh</a> with instructions on how to install it using git.</p>

    <p>Well, I got some more updates for you all.</p>

<p>My Sublime Text 2 Guard Plugin has recently been recognized as an essential Sublime Text 2 plugin on a nettuts+ blog post. Thanks to this publicity and the exposure via Package Control, Twitter, GitHub, and Google I have gotten some decent feedback, especially around my recent addition of colored output. Thanks to all that feedback I have pushed out the following improvements to the Sublime Text 2 Guard Plugin:</p>

<ul>
<li>Support for directory paths with spaces (<a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/pull/19'>#19</a>, Thanks <a href='http://github.com/ffmike'>@ffmike</a>)</li>

<li>Fixed dash based coloring issue (<a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/16'>#16</a>)</li>

<li>Fixed single quote based coloring issue (<a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/17'>#17</a>)</li>

<li>Fixed question mark based coloring issue (<a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/20'>#20</a>)</li>

<li>Fixed period based coloring issue (<a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/21'>#21</a>)</li>

<li>Fixed success dot section identification &amp; coloring issue (<a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/22'>#22</a>)</li>

<li>Fixed a second single quote based coloring issue (<a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/23'>#23</a>)</li>

<li>Added command relativity (<a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/24'>#24</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The above break down of improvements include primarily a bunch of coloring fixes, command relativity, and one very important issue that deserves some recognition, issue <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/pull/19'>#19</a> by <a href='http://github.com/ffmike'>@ffmike</a>. This is the Sublime Text 2 Guard Plugin&#8217;s first contribution. Much thanks goes out to <a href='http://github.com/ffmike'>@ffmike</a> for being our first contributor.</p>

<p>As usual if any of you have identified bugs or features that you would like added please submit them on the GitHub Issues page for the <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues?sort=created&amp;direction=desc&amp;state=open'>Sublime Text 2 Guard Plugin</a>.</p>

    <p>Hey all,</p>

<p>I know there are a number of you who have been eagerly awaiting this moment. I sure have been. I am proud to announce the first release of the <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard'>Sublime Text 2 Guard Plugin</a> that provides colored output. Basically, it ended up that I had to define a language file to identify the entities in the output and then define a theme to color those identified entities. Once, I did that I simply programatically set the color_scheme and syntax options for the output panel and like magic colors worked. Given the complexity of the language definition and the limited test cases I had when developing I am sure there are going to be some bugs to work out. So, as usual please create issues if you find any of these <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues'>issues</a>.</p>

    <p>Hey all,</p>

<p>My Sublime Text 2 Guard plugin has been out for a couple weeks now and it has definitely gotten some more usage under its belt. Thanks to everyone for your usage and feedback. As a result of the feedback and user generated issues I have released a new version to tighten it up a bit both from a user experience stand point as well as a stability standpoint. This release includes the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Now installable via <a href='http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control'>Package Control</a></li>

<li>Fixed Guard won&#8217;t start when installled via Package Control (<a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/11'>issue #11</a>)</li>

<li>Added auto show output feature (<a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/12'>issue #12</a>)</li>

<li>Replaced <code>#!/bin/sh</code> with <code>#!/bin/bash</code> in internal scripts</li>
</ul>

<p>For info on how to get the latest version or how to report bugs, feature requsts, etc. Please check out the GitHub page for the <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard'>sublime_guard</a> project.</p>

    <p>Hey all,</p>

<p>I was having some difficulties with a couple bugs in the Sublime Text 2 Guard plugin I have been working on. So, I decided I would drop Jon Skinner, developer of Sublime Text 2, an e-mail and see if he knew about the issues I was having and hopefully of solutions/work arounds for them. Jon, was very helpful in terms of better understanding the issues as well as suggesting some work arounds.</p>

<p>Anyways, given the input from Jon I took another look at the bugs/features of the Guard plugin and decided to tackle them tonight. The following items show the progress that I made tonight with respect to the Sublime Text 2 Guard plugin:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enabled native Sublime Text 2 word wrap in the Guard output view.</li>

<li>Guard now exits properly when Sublime Text 2 exits/dies.</li>

<li>Added default key bindings to show Guard output view (super+shift+c)</li>

<li>Submitted a pull request to get the Guard plugin added to the <a href='http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control'>Package Control</a> repository list.</li>
</ul>

<p>As usual I am looking for feedback issues (feature requests, bug fixes, etc.) You can find the project as <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard'>sublime_guard</a> on GitHub. As of tonight I am down to two feature requests. So, please create bugs in the issues if you run into any so that I can work on fixing them sooner rather than later.</p>

    <p>Just dropping a quick note to all that follow my blog. Last night I made a numeber updates to the <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard'>Guard Plugin</a> for <a href='http://www.sublimetext.com/2'>Sublime Text 2</a>. Most of these were in direct response to feedback that I got from users after making the initial release on my blog, I think, two days ago. The modifications I made are enumarted below:</p>

<ul>
<li>The biggest addition is <code>RVM detection and integration</code>. The plugin is now intelligent enough to detect if you have RVM installed and detect if you are using a Project specific .rvmrc and of course respond by calling Guard appropriately depending on the case.</li>

<li>Another relatively small fix is a <code>vertical only auto-scroll</code>. Before, if Guard output went to the right past the width of the pane it was auto-scrolling to the right and then bouncing back to the left at the next line. Now, it always scrolls down the left most column of the output basically making it auto-scroll vertically.</li>

<li>Third I added some output preprocessing that <code>strips out the Terminal Color
Codes</code> so that the output is a bit cleaner.</li>

<li>I also added a lot of <code>descriptive output and error handling and output</code> to let the user better know what is failing so they might be able to debug the situation a bit better.</li>
</ul>

<p>As always if you have any feedback (feature requests, bug reports, etc.) you can simply create an issue for the project at the projects <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues'>GitHub Issues Page</a>.</p>

<p>If you are new to the <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard'>Guard Plugin</a> for <a href='http://www.sublimetext.com/2'>Sublime Text 2</a> you can find installation instructions and document on the <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard'>GitHub Page</a>.</p>

    <p>Hi all. I know it has been a while. Please forgive me. My life has been a little crazy. I am still in the process of buliding my house. I also recently became engaged so I am trying to deal with wedding planning. Beyond that I am still trying to get all my development work done for RealPractice, my side company, and all of my open source projects.</p>

<p>Anyways, I needed a break from serious projects and decided it was time for a small fun project that would potentially help me develop the more serious projects more efficiently. A while back I started using a new text editor called <a href='http://www.sublimetext.com/2'>Sublime Text 2</a>. Basically it is what TextMate 2 promised (and failed) to be and more.</p>

<p>So, since I have been using this for a while and I have been developing Ruby and Rails apps lately using BDD and TDD I decided it was time to remove the annoyance of having to switch to the terminal after each little development iteration to check Guard&#8217;s output to see why my tests are failing. Wow that was a run on sentence. Oh, well it is 2 am and I just finished the plugin so bare with me. Anyways. Therefore, I decided it was the perfect opportunity to build a <a href='http://www.sublimetext.com/2'>Sublime Text 2</a> plugin that integrates Guard into it.</p>

<p>It is available with its documentation on GitHub at <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard'>http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard</a>. Please don&#8217;t hesitate to go grab it, use it, extend it, contribute back, report bugs, or throw me new feature requests.</p>

    <p>So for those of that don&#8217;t know, I lead of team of software developers. For a long time now I have noticed a number of gaps in the industry with respect to software development and team collaboration. One area that I always felt was missing some love was group chat.</p>

<p>Sure, there are a large number of different chat protocols and applications that implement them all. However, they generally miss an archived history that has full text searching. Beyond the group chat is prime location to distribute push notifications when Git repositories that the team is working with have changes pushed to them. Because of these two issues and number of other that I really don&#8217;t want to get into at this point I have started a new open source project called <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/archaic'>&#8220;Archaic&#8221;</a>.</p>

<p><a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/archaic'>Archaic</a> is a Rails application that provides archiving of IRC channel chats with a full text search interface as well as general developer helpers. It is composed of two pieces, an IRC Bot and the Rails application. Technically they both share the rails environment as the IRC Bot should be run with rails runner. You can checkout the project at the following: <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/archaic'>http://github.com/cyphactor/archaic</a>.</p>

<p>I plan to keep the master branch functional so feel free to use the master branch. It currently has the following features.</p>

<ul>
<li>IRC Chat Archiving</li>

<li>Full Text Chat Archive Searching with Context (to expand context simply click on resulting match)</li>

<li>Week number helper (when anyone in IRC channel types &#8220;weeknum&#8221; it replies with current week number)</li>

<li>Ticket number helper (when anyone in IRC channel types &#8220;#\d+&#8221; it replies with link to that ticket)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the initial introduction to this project and I am sure it has numerous directions that it can and will grow into. I very much welcome your thoughts, suggestions, feature requests, bug reports, testing, etc.</p>

<p>I believe that having a good central place of communication for a team even if they are working in the same office helps at least as a mechanism for keeping your devs notified about repo pushes close to real time.</p>

<p>Anyways, enjoy!</p>

    <p>If you happened to read my previous post <a href='/2010/10/24/An-Ideal-Git-Based-Team-Workflow.html'>An Ideal Git Based Team Workflow</a> this posting is a result of taking that concept and discussing it heavily with my team as well as further contemplating the issues and solutions.</p>

<h3 id='the_real_requirements'>The Real Requirements</h3>

<p>After reviewing my thoughts and discussing things further with my team I determined that a number of aspects of the previously defined workflow are not needed. In fact they were overcomplicating the workflow due to a lack of understanding of the actual requirements. One such requirement was the concept that branches should parallel deployment environments. This is not actually a requirement and I was sadly imposing it as one in my initial workflow. In hindsight this was primarily due to the fact that it was the focal point of a number of discussions with one of my developers, Michael Genereux. This singular mistaken requirement imposes a huge amount of complexity and constraint into the workflow for no significant value in my opinion. The set of requirements that I now believe are true requirements of our workflow are presented in the list below.</p>

<ul>
<li>Overhead on the developers should be as minimal as possible</li>

<li>Overhead on the integrators should be as minimal as possible</li>

<li>Hotfix deployments should be able to trivially be made</li>

<li>Content deployments should be able to trivially be made</li>

<li>Iterative development cycles can happen parallel to Hotfix and Content development &amp; deployment</li>

<li>Code review and feedback is needed for our inexperienced developers so that they can learn</li>
</ul>

<h3 id='the_two_roles'>The Two Roles</h3>

<p>After, isolating the correct requirements I determined that in order to satisfy the minimalistic overhead requirements as well as the code review/feedback requirements we were going to need two different roles within our workflow. The first role is what I will from this point on refer to as an &#8220;Integrator&#8221;. In reality an &#8220;Integrator&#8221; in my mind is simply a developer that is skilled enough to follow carefully designed policy, doesn&#8217;t need much guidance, and fully understands the core concepts of Git and why the workflow policies exist. The second role is what I will refer to as a &#8220;Newb&#8221;. A &#8220;Newb&#8221; in this case is simply a less experienced developer that may need more guidance, heavier code review, and more direction in general.</p>

<h4 id='the_integrator'>The Integrator</h4>

<p>The group of developers which fall within the &#8220;Integrator&#8221; title are responsible for not only doing their normal iteration development but also for performing code review and providing feedback to the &#8220;Newbs&#8221;. Beyond that they are responsible for following the provided policies to manage Hotfixes, Content changes, and the normal iterative development cycle. The policies for each of these areas with respect to &#8220;The Integrator&#8221; role are provided below.</p>

<h4 id='hotfixes'>Hotfixes</h4>

<p>In this workflow I am defining hotfixes simply as changes that have to be made and deployed abruptly out side of a normal iteration deployment. These are normally severe bugs that drastically hinder the user experience and must be fixed asap.</p>

<p>Developers of the &#8220;Integrator&#8221; role are required when creating a hotfix or series of hotfixes to create a remote branch for the hotfixes within the current weeks iteration. The branch should be based on the release that the hotfixes are going to apply to. Secondarily the name of the branch should be of the following format, <code>&quot;week_&lt;week number&gt;_hotfixes&quot;</code>. Once the remote branch exists development of the hotfixes should occur on the newly created hotfixes branch. Once the branch reaches a state in which it is ready to be released into the accelerated pipeline it should be tagged using the release naming scheme and deployed.</p>

<h3 id='content_changes'>Content Changes</h3>

<p>In this workflow I am defining content changes simply as changes which need to be deployed on a more frequent basis than the normal iteration deployments. Beyond that they are generally changes to assets or textual changes needed by marketing, etc. which have less of a functional involvement.</p>

<p>Developers of the &#8220;Integrator&#8221; role are not usually the developers making these changes directly. However, they are responsible for reviewing, integrating, and providing feedback to the &#8220;Newbs&#8221; that are making these changes through the &#8220;Newb&#8221; workflow as defined below. Hence, the &#8220;Integrators&#8221; should pull in the &#8220;Newbs&#8221; content changes after reviewing them and merge them into the current weeks remote branch for content changes. This branch should have a name of the following format, <code>&quot;week_&lt;week number&gt;_content&quot;</code>. If this branch doesn&#8217;t exist at the time in which an &#8220;Integrator&#8221; needs it they are responsible for creating it. Once this branch reaches a state in which it is ready to be deployed, it should be tagged using the release naming scheme and deployed into the pipeline.</p>

<h3 id='normal_iteration'>Normal Iteration</h3>

<p>In this workflow a normal iteration is simple a release cycle of two weeks. Within a normal iteration &#8220;Integrators&#8221; are responsible for not only managing content and hotfixes from &#8220;Newbs&#8221; but also managing normal iteration development from &#8220;Newbs&#8221;. Beyond that &#8220;Integrators&#8221; are responsible for performing their normal development work for the current iteration. All development changes should be performed inside specific topic branches and never directly on the master branch. If features/bugs are large enough that they may consume multiple days of development they should have their own remote topic branch. This allows other developers to participate or at a minimum obtain the partially completed changes which you have made. Beyond that never developing directly on master makes abrupt context switching trivial. Once a topic branch has reached a point in which it is ready to be merged into the current weeks iteration and ready for the pipeline the &#8220;Integrator&#8221; should merge it into the master branch and push the updated master branch to the central repository.</p>

<h3 id='the_newb'>The Newb</h3>

<p>The developers which fall within the &#8220;Newb&#8221; title are responsible for performing their development tasks and learning the process and value of the workflow policies as well as the technologies and languages which they are using. Ideally the &#8220;Newbs&#8221; progress to &#8220;Integrators&#8221; eventually. Their tasks similar to the &#8220;Integrators&#8221; may consist of development work for Hotfixes, Content Changes, or Normal Iteration development. However, one way they differ is in the process and policies they have to follow when performing these tasks. The workflow for each of these types of changes with respect to &#8220;Newbs&#8221; is provided below.</p>

<h4 id='hotfixes'>Hotfixes</h4>

<p>A &#8220;Newb&#8221; similar to an &#8220;Integrator&#8221; is required to do all development within topic branches. However, when a &#8220;Newb&#8221; believes they are ready to have their changes included in the current weeks hotfixes branch they must make a Pull Request via GitHub to their upstream repository. GitHub will then notify all of the &#8220;Integrators&#8221; of the new pull request and allow them to review the changes, provide any feedback and merge the changes in. GitHub will also allow the &#8220;Integrators&#8221; to throw the changes back to the &#8220;Newb&#8221; with feedback rather than merging the changes in.</p>

<h3 id='content_changes'>Content Changes</h3>

<p>With respect to a &#8220;Newb&#8221; content changes work exactly the same way as Hotfixes. They simply develop their content changes and submit an appropriate Pull Request via GitHub to their upstream repository so that an &#8220;Integrator&#8221; can appropriately deal with their changes and provide any feedback.</p>

<h3 id='normal_iteration'>Normal Iteration</h3>

<p>&#8220;Newbs&#8221; follow the same process for Normal Iteration development as they did Hotfixes and Content Changes. Develop the changes in a topic branch and submit a Pull Request via GitHub.</p>

<h3 id='requirements_review'>Requirements Review</h3>

<p>I believe that the above workflows and policies provide a solid basis for a well rounded team with very little overhead and a decent amount of flexibility with respect to parallel releases being made at different rates. Please note additional parallel releases can be added simply by adding additional conceptual types of changes to my current list of Hotfixes, Content Changes, and Normal Iteration Development.</p>

<h3 id='release_naming_scheme'>Release Naming Scheme</h3>

<p>Given that we are developing by either week or two week iterations I have decided that we should use the following naming scheme for tagging releases:</p>

<p><code>release-YY.&lt;week_num&gt;-rc&lt;release candidate counter&gt;</code></p>

<p>The YY represents the year for 2010 it should be 10. The <code>&lt;week_num&gt;</code> is the week number and the <code>&lt;release candidate counter&gt;</code> is a counter for this iteration that reset at the beginning of each iteration. Once a final tagged release for production is ready to be made it should use the following naming scheme.</p>

<p><code>release-YY.&lt;week_num&gt;-rf&lt;release candidate counter&gt;</code></p>

<p>All the variables in the naming scheme for final tags are the same as those in the latest rc for a weekly iteration. For example if the latest rc is release-10.34-rc6 and no changes have been made since that tag and the code is ready to be tagged for a production release it should be tagged as release-10.34-rf6.</p>

<h3 id='topic_branch_naming_scheme'>Topic Branch Naming Scheme</h3>

<p>When naming topic branches it is required that you use the following naming scheme.</p>

<p><code>&lt;type char&gt;&lt;ticket id&gt;_&lt;name&gt;</code></p>

<p>The <code>&lt;type char&gt;</code> is a character that defines if it is a task (t), bug (b), or feature (f). The ticket id is the unique identifier of the ticket in the ticketing system that corresponds to this topic branch. The <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> is a short but meaningful name that describes the topic branch.</p>

<h3 id='dont_tie_deployment_environments_to_branches'>Don&#8217;t Tie Deployment Environments to Branches</h3>

<p>So, as I stated in the opening I was assuming in the previous article that each deployment environment should have a branch that parallels it. This was an idea that was presented to me by one of my developers and I mistakenly ran with it. The following is an explanation of why I believe doing this is not valuable and potentially costly. Also, I am not pointing this out to pick on my developer. In fact it is quite the opposite. I am glad that he forced me to think about alternatives in great depth because the process has only more solidified my belief in the workflow and policies presented above. Beyond that, the explanation of my opinion may help him or others come to the same or even a better conclusion/workflow.</p>

<p>For some reason I couldn&#8217;t initially place my finger on what was wrong with using branches that paralleled the deployment environments of development, qa, staging, and production. I knew that I really hated the overhead of having to deal with cherry picking changes from one branch to the next to simulate the pipeline but I still simply saw that as its own issue which inspired me to come up with the previous and very flawed workflow, An Ideal Git Based Team Workflow.</p>

<p>Today after an insane amount of contemplation, discussion, and fiddling with the workflow the answer finally came to me. The problem with the Deployment Environments mapping to branches is that from a workflow perspective we don&#8217;t really care about the deployment environments other than the tagged release that is currently deployed in each environment. This information can easily be obtained without branches that map to the environments by correlating the deployed tag in a given environment to the matching tag in Git.</p>

<p>What we do care about with respect to a workflow however is the ability to be able to cleanly share code changes as well as be able to handle a number of parallel releases. I have chosen to represent these parellel releases via different classifications of changes in the above workflow. Specifically, Hotfixes, Content Changes, and Normal Iteration Development.</p>

<p>When you test these two models it is very interesting because in the model where you have branches for each deployment environment you end up spending a huge amount of overhead simulating something for no reason. The primary cost in overhead is the amount of merging and cherry-picking that is necessary to keep the states of the branches in line. Secondly, it does NOT allow you to make parallel deployments of various types unless those changes happen to fall within the various stages of your deployment pipeline.</p>

<p>The second model in which you have classifications of changes that map to parallel releases, the overhead of maintaining the deployment environment branches is completely eliminated. It also models the actual situation with respect to code and the natural requirements surrounding what needs to be done with/to that code. Therefore, it requires no additional overhead or maintenance.</p>

<h3 id='conclusion'>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The above is why I believe the model in which branches parallel deployment environments is costly and has no perceived value in comparison to its costs. As always I am interested to hear peoples thoughts and opinions with respect to my postings, so don&#8217;t hesitate to share.</p>

    <p>If you don&#8217;t know me there is one thing you should know about me. I love tools that help make things easier. Git has definitely been one of those tools for me. However, I always felt like there was something in the power of Git that wasn&#8217;t really being taken advantage of because of peoples past knowledge and training of centralized source control systems such as SVN. Git provides many advantages which are difficult to argue for an individual developers workflow. However, I am more interested in a solid workflow for a team that has very little overhead using Git.</p>

<p>The team of developers that I lead up for RealPractice just released our first Beta (still pretty alpha) of our product. Before this point in time I really hadn&#8217;t put in place a specific workflow largely because we had a small enough team that it was easily manageable and secondly because we simply had a huge amount of development before one release. Therefore, if things were broken during that period of time it was fine as long as what was in got fixed for the release. However, now that we have made the release I require a team workflow that gives us much more control of the development process, what gets included in the product, and at what stages things get included.</p>

<h3 id='centralized_branch_workflow'>Centralized Branch Workflow</h3>

<p>To begin with I looked heavily at a model that I have used in the past and seen used before. One of my developers Michael Genereux recommended this workflow as well when I told my team I was looking for a good workflow. However, I have only used this with very very small teams (2 man teams) in the past. Michael seemed to be a big supporter of this method so I discussed it with him and started playing with this workflow again.</p>

<p>This workflow uses Git in a centralized maner where you have an origin and that origin has branches for each of the stages/environments, experimental, development, qa, staging, and production. The idea is that development happens on the respective branches appropriately and gets merged backwards into the experimental so that it can follow the normal flow through the environments as one would want. In my mind this has a few major issues which are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Development occurs in upper level branches. Ideally even if you are writing a bug fix you want that bug fix to go through all of the stages starting at the beginning. One could argue that you could develop the bug fix in the experimental branch and merge it into development branch and so on. However, this leads to the second issue.</li>

<li>This model works fine if you have a very small team that is extremely good at managing and knowing their commit history because when a change is made to experimental it somehow needs to get put into the development branch. Some would say you simply need to merge it into development branch. This argument is fine if you are a single dev and develop in a linear fashion on the experimental branch. However, if there is a team of people all sharing the same experimental branch then it can be a pain in the ass to identify which commits belong to bug fix Y or feature X and need to be cherry-picked into the next branch.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can probably see from above points alone, managing the code base and what gets included in it can be very hard and consume an insane amount of time. Especially, if you have to go through and isolate commits that need to be cherry-picked into the next branch all the time. Plus, think about the fact that I am only talking about one level experimental to development. This same process has to occur at every level of the process experimental all the way through production.</p>

<h3 id='github_to_the_rescue_pull_requests'>GitHub to the Rescue (Pull Requests)</h3>

<p>So after playing with the above a bit more and thinking pretty heavily I decided there has to be a better way. I started thinking about how I develop and how I could commit code that would then go through the environmental pipeline appropriately and not have the same overhead. Thats when I realized that the biggest overhead in the above process is the fact that the devs have to isolate commits for cherry-picking all the time. Hence, I started looking for solution in the Git space and didn&#8217;t find anything directly within Git that seemed clean. Therefore, I started thinking about tools out side of Git and GitHub came to mind. With GitHub if you are using the pull based distributed model GitHub provides a feature called a &#8220;Pull Request&#8221;. This basically allows a developer to send a message to the upstream repository requesting that they pull in some changes. The beauty of the GitHub &#8220;Pull Request&#8221; is that it associates a range of commits with the pull request.</p>

<p>Hence, it allows a developer to develop a bug fix or feature in their repository and then simply create a &#8220;Pull Request&#8221; that includes the the proper commit range. Then when the upstream developer/integrator receives the &#8220;Pull Request&#8221; they can pull it into their repository and merge it in appropriately knowing exactly what the proper commit range is. This drastically reduces the amount of time needed to isolate the commits using the Centralized Branch Workflow. In my mind having the Pull Requests contain the commit range is brilliant on GitHub&#8217;s part because it is an unbelievable time savor. Plus they provide a web interface for testing conflict states of &#8220;Pull Requests&#8221; and merging them in as well as a communication mechanism to submiting the developers in case you have to deny a pull request.</p>

<h3 id='how_to_use_this_github_pull_request_model'>How to use this GitHub Pull Request Model</h3>

<p>The following is how I want my developers to use this model. In ones own local repository they should create a topic branch for every task, bug, etc. Generally the branches should be named with the id of the task or bug so that we can identify commits with bugs and tasks in history. This also eases the local workflow to allow me to switch a dev from one focus to another abruptly (I try to do this almost never, but sometimes it happens). Generally, a dev should be developing the bug fix, task, or feature and reach a point at which they believe that they have enough for me to pull their changes into the development branch. At that point they should create a &#8220;Pull Request&#8221; because GitHub will help them by figuring out the commit range. If they continue to develop past the point where they want me to pull and neglect to make the &#8220;Pull Request&#8221; until later then they will have to isolate the commit range they want me to pull using GitHub (which is still easier than just using Git by itself). Note that keeping each task, bug fix, etc in its own topic branch makes commit isolation much easier for developers.</p>

<p>Once, they have sent the pull request all integrators are notified of the pull request and then have the opportunity to pull the changes into the appropriate branch and move those changes up the pipeline as they see fit. Some developers see the act of making a pull request as overhead. However, they should note that it isn&#8217;t a side effect of GitHub it is a side effect of having to move change sets up the environment pipeline. GitHub just provides a tool that makes it easier than doing it without GitHub.</p>

<h3 id='moving_changes_up_the_pipeline'>Moving Changes up the Pipeline</h3>

<p>The last step in this process is the act of moving things up the environment pipeline. This is much the same process as in the Centralized Branch Workflow with one distinct difference, it is in a much more controlled environment because you don&#8217;t have all of your devs sharing the same branch space. Instead you as the integrator control the branch space. You may be asking, who cares? Well, I do for one because it makes moving changes up the pipeline much easier because it requires far far less cherry-picking. In fact the majority of the time all that is needed is to merge pull requests into development, merge development up the pipeline, and so on and so forth. Do note however that every once and a while you do need to cherry-pick but it is far and few in comparison with the Centralized Branch Workflow.</p>

<p>So this is the current workflow that I am going with. I haven&#8217;t completely decided on how much access I will give my team with respect to direct pushing if any. But, that is just a balance that has to be found over time in my experience. Anyways, I hope the above gives some insight into the workflow and why I have chosen it.</p>

    <p>So, as many of you may know I recently took a position heading up a new software engineering team that is responsible for producing the new products. One of my first actions when I came on board was switching my team over from SVN to Git. One of the engineers on the team abandoned a branch in one of our Git repositories because he didn&#8217;t think he would need it anymore. Soon, after he realized that he wanted something from that branch but now he couldn&#8217;t see the brach anymore in &#8216;gitk &#8211;all&#8217; or any of the other tools because he abandoned it. But, it has to still be there right, it is Git.</p>

<p>I knew there was a way to do this in Git and I have done it in the past but I couldn&#8217;t remember how. After I explained a bit more to him about the internals of Git and he went off and did some exploration he came back to me with his found solution which follows:</p>

<p><code>git fsck --unreachable| cut -f3 -d&#39; &#39;|xargs git rev-list --header|less</code></p>

<p>I know there is some other way to find abandoned nodes in Git but I still can&#8217;t remember. Anyways, just figured I would share this method in the hopes that it would help someone out there. It may not be exactly what you want with respect to the &#8216;cut&#8217; or &#8216;xargs&#8217; but I will let you all play with it a bit to get exactly what you want.</p>

    <p>When I took over the software engineering team at my job. I had the opportunity to start fresh with a new ticketing, bug tracking, and project management toolset. Over, the years I have used a number of different tools most recently Trac and Lighthouse. However, I can go on and on with the tools that I have tried. When, I came on board they were currently using Jira which I know is big in certain communities, however, everyone seemed to hate it and I have a bunch of issues with it that I don&#8217;t want to get into. Anyways, so I spent some time and reviewed the following project management and ticketing systems again to just get a refresher and see where they were at and if any of them would work for me and my team.</p>

<ul>
<li>Redmine - <a href='http://www.redmine.org/'>http://www.redmine.org/</a></li>

<li>Basecamp - <a href='http://basecamphq.com/'>http://basecamphq.com/</a></li>

<li>Devalot - <a href='http://projects.noscience.net/devalot'>http://projects.noscience.net/devalot</a></li>

<li>ProjectPier - <a href='http://www.projectpier.org/'>http://www.projectpier.org/</a></li>

<li>Trac - <a href='http://trac.edgewall.org/'>http://trac.edgewall.org/</a></li>

<li>Jira - <a href='http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/'>http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/</a></li>

<li>Collabtive - <a href='http://collabtive.o-dyn.de/'>http://collabtive.o-dyn.de/</a></li>

<li>eGroupWare - <a href='http://www.egroupware.org/Home'>http://www.egroupware.org/Home</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So after heavy review of each of the above listed project management tools I decided on Redmine because it is hugely flexible, has a decent community behind it. It does have what I would consider some usability issues and some major design issues in the UI. However, once you learn those it is pretty much capable of everything I need it to do. When, you look at other solutions they all seem to be lacking very important features.</p>

    <p>Hey all. I know its been a while since my last post. But, life has been a little crazy. I recently took a position at a new company called <a href='http://realpractice.com'>RealPractice</a> heading up the software engineering team that is responsible for all of their new products. I am very excited to start up a new team and build some amazing software. I can&#8217;t wait to get started building a strong team that builds even stronger software.</p>

<p>I have a feeling that this will put a bit of a slow down into the progress on the house. But, this is what I love doing, so I think it is worth it. This may also for a temporary period of time also slow down my rate of posting with respect to software tid-bits. But, I will come back stronger than ever with more stuff to post about.</p>

    <p>Today was one of those days where I woke up and something was just off with respect to my workflow for some reason. I was frustrated with the fact that I had to load a browser and go to a website to see what my tickets were for the day. Instinctively I just wanted my tickets to magically be in my head so I didn&#8217;t have to go through all those steps. So, I started thinking about this problem more and more as the day went by and I came to the conclusion that I really have two problems.</p>

<ol>
<li>I have tickets dispersed through multiple ticketing system.</li>

<li>I hate having to go through so many steps to see my tickets.</li>
</ol>

<p>When I started thinking about my two problems I realized that I have my tickets in roughly four different applications/services. These applications/services are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href='http://trac.edgewall.org/'>Trac</a> - Web based project management/task management tool</li>

<li><a href='http://lighthouseapp.com/'>Lighthouse</a> - Web based project management/task management tool</li>

<li><a href='http://github.com/'>GitHub</a> - Web based Git repository management system and issue tracking tool</li>

<li><a href='http://culturedcode.com/things/'>Things</a> - Desktop task management system</li>
</ul>

<p>Beyond having multiple ticket sources, most of them have multiple accounts for various reasons (contract jobs I have done, etc.). Being in a specific environment while working within that scope/environment is fine. For example if I am working on Project X it makes sense that I be in project X&#8217;s environment. However, the situation that I am frustrated with is the initialization and transition periods which exist before you start working on a project and when you are switching from one project to the next project.</p>

<p>Based on my issues and the situation I am frustrated with I have come up with a small set of requirements for a solution. These requirements are listed below.</p>

<ol>
<li>Tickets from all ticket sources must exist in a dashboard</li>

<li>This dashboard must require zero effort/steps to view it</li>

<li>This dashboard must automatically update with zero effort/steps</li>
</ol>

<p>As many of you know despite the fact that I write software for various platforms and in various languages my platform for development is generally Mac OS X. Given that Mac OS X was my environment, I started thinking about this requirement set and thinking about how I could make something that required zero effort/steps to view it. The closest thing I could come up with was having my tickets displayed on my desktop. After a few minutes of googling based on that idea I found an awesome tool for Mac OS X called <a href='http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/'>GeekTool</a>. Among other things, <a href='http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/'>GeekTool</a> will run shell scripts/console applications for you on a set frequency and display their output to a defined section of your desktop. This was perfect in my opinion so I played with it for a few minutes and decide that I was going to use <a href='http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/'>GeekTool</a>.</p>

<p>Given the functionality of <a href='http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/'>GeekTool</a> all that was really left was to write shell scripts/console applications that output all of my tickets from the various ticket sources and I would have a very quick and functional solution to my issue. Hence, I got to writing and pumped out the following short little Ruby scripts, and one AppleScript script to provide output of all my tickets from the various sources.</p>

<p>The following is a ruby script that pulls all my tickets in from all of my various <a href='http://lighthouseapp.com/'>Lighthouse</a> accounts and projects.</p>

  <section>
    <p>I recently wrote a jQuery Plugin that I am calling jquery_comphist. It is a jQuery Plugin that draws a Comparative Histogram of a provided population divided into two major groups with any number of shared sub-groups. One of the most common uses for such a feature is when you are trying to display demographics data on some population. Anyways, as usual the code is available at my GitHub page here and you can see a demo of it below.</p>
<div style='background-color: #f3f3f3; padding: 20px;'>
<div id='comphist_example' style='width: 500px; height: 200px;'>&nbsp;</div>
</div><script type='text/javascript'>
$(function () {
  function showCompHistTooltip(x, y, contents) {
    $("<div id='comphist1tooltip'>" + contents + '</div>').css({ position: 'absolute', display: 'none', top: y - 20, left: x - 30, border: '1px solid #fdd', padding: '2px', 'background-color': '#fee', opacity: 1 }).appendTo("body").fadeIn(200);
  }

  var comphist_data = {
    population_label: 'Active Fans This Week',
    group_1_label: 'Male', group_2_label: 'Female',
    subgroups: [
    { label: '13-17', group_1_count: 3, group_2_count: 16 },
    { label: '18-24', group_1_count: 7, group_2_count: 27 },
    { label: '25-34', group_1_count: 3, group_2_count: 29 },
    { label: '35-44', group_1_count: 2, group_2_count: 9 },
    { label: '45-54', group_1_count: 0, group_2_count: 4 },
    { label: '55+', group_1_count: 0, group_2_count: 0 }
    ],
    non_demo_count: 0
  };
  $("#comphist_example").comphist({}, comphist_data);

  $("#comphist_example").bind("barover", function (e, perc, pos) {
    $("#comphist1tooltip").remove();
    showCompHistTooltip(pos.left, pos.top, perc);
  });
  
  $("#comphist_example").bind("barout", function (e, perc, pos) {
    $("#comphist1tooltip").remove();
  });
});
</script>
<p>With the jQuery Comparative Histogram (CompHist) Plugin you can easily represent populations and information about them. A prime usage exampe of this is demographics. All the styling is done via CSS. Hence the style is easily modified. It does the calculations for you and it allows for non listed group counts via a non_demo_count data option.</p>

<p>The above demo was produced by defining a few code snippets. The first snippet is a snippet of HTML that includes the jQuery Comparative Histogram javascript source file and CSS style sheet. Note: The jQuery Comparative Histogram javascript source file needs to come after the standard jQuery javascript source file. An example of this snippet is as follows:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='html'><span class='nt'>&lt;script </span><span class='na'>type=</span><span class='s'>&quot;text/javascript&quot;</span> <span class='na'>src=</span><span class='s'>&quot;../jquery.comphist.js&quot;</span><span class='nt'>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span class='nt'>&lt;link</span> <span class='na'>rel=</span><span class='s'>&quot;stylesheet&quot;</span> <span class='na'>type=</span><span class='s'>&quot;text/css&quot;</span> <span class='na'>href=</span><span class='s'>&quot;../stylesheets/jquery.comphist.css&quot;</span><span class='nt'>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Note: In the above snippet the href values are likely to be different in your case. The second code snippet is simply a single line of HTML where the div that is to be the Comparative Histogram. It is key that this div has an id that is easily referenced and a set height and width. An example of this snippet is as follows:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='html'><span class='nt'>&lt;div</span> <span class='na'>id=</span><span class='s'>&quot;compplaceholder&quot;</span> <span class='na'>style=</span><span class='s'>&quot;width: 375px; height: 200px;&quot;</span><span class='nt'>&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The third code snippet needed is the javascript that defines the data, creates the Comparative Histogram in the specified div, and handles the hover functionality. An example of this is seen below.</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='html'><span class='nt'>&lt;script </span><span class='na'>type=</span><span class='s'>&quot;text/javascript&quot;</span><span class='nt'>&gt;</span>

  <section>
    <p>Hey boys and girls. I just got finished coding support for Multi-series bar graphs into Flot (a jQuery based JavaScript graphing library). Hence, I figured I would share not only the code but a little preview of it below. The code for it can be found at my GitHub account here. Please enjoy the little demo below.</p>
<div style='background-color: #f3f3f3; padding: 20px;'>
<div id='placeholder' style='width:500px;height:200px;'>&nbsp;</div>
</div><p id='hoverdata'>Mouse hovers at (<span id='x'>0</span>, <span id='y'>0</span>). <span id='clickdata' /></p>
<p>With the multi-series bar graph support, you can have Flot display the series side by side. This is useful when you are interested in visually comparing series and grouping segments you want to columns in series that you are specifically interested in comparing.</p>
<script id='source'>
$(function () {
  var ms_data = [{"label":"FOO","data":[[0,80],[1,70],[2,100],[3,60],[4,102]]},
                 {"label":"BAR","data":[[0,10],[1,20],[2,30],[3,40],[4,80]]},
                 {"label":"CAR","data":[[0,5],[1,10],[2,15],[3,20],[4,25]]}]
  var ms_ticks = [[0,"1/28"],[1,"1/29"],[2,"1/30"],[3,"1/31"],[4,"1/32"]];
    
    function plotWithOptions() {
      $.plot($("#placeholder"), ms_data, {
        bars: { show: true, barWidth: 0.6, series_spread: true, align: "center" },
        xaxis: { ticks: ms_ticks, autoscaleMargin: .10 },
        grid: { hoverable: true, clickable: true }
      });
    }
    
    function showTooltip(x, y, contents) {
        $("<div id='tooltip'>" + contents + '</div>').css( { position: 'absolute', display: 'none', top: y + 5, left: x + 5, border: '1px solid #fdd', padding: '2px', 'background-color': '#fee', opacity: 0.80 }).appendTo("body").show();
    }

    plotWithOptions();

    $("#placeholder").bind("plothover", function (event, pos, item) {
      $("#x").text(pos.x.toFixed(2));
      $("#y").text(pos.y.toFixed(2));
        if (item) {
            if (previousPoint != item.datapoint) {
                previousPoint = item.datapoint;
              
                $("#tooltip").remove();
                var x = item.datapoint[0].toFixed(2),
                    y = item.datapoint[1].toFixed(2);
              
                showTooltip(item.pageX, item.pageY,
                            item.series.label + " Group id: " + Math.floor(x) + ", y = " + y + ", seriesIndex: " + item.seriesIndex);
            }
        }
        else {
            $("#tooltip").remove();
            previousPoint = null;            
        }
    });

    $("#placeholder").bind("plotclick", function (event, pos, item) {
        if (item) {
            $("#clickdata").text("You clicked bar " + item.dataIndex + " in " + item.series.label + ".");
        }
    });
});
</script>
<p>The above demo was produced by defining a few code snippets. The first snippet is a snippet of HTML that includes the customized Flot javascript source file. Note: The Flot javascript source file needs to come after the standard jQuery javascript source file. An example of this snippet is as follows:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='html'><span class='c'>&lt;!--[if IE]&gt;&lt;script language=&quot;javascript&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;../excanvas.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;![endif]--&gt;</span>
<span class='nt'>&lt;script </span><span class='na'>language=</span><span class='s'>&quot;javascript&quot;</span> <span class='na'>type=</span><span class='s'>&quot;text/javascript&quot;</span> <span class='na'>src=</span><span class='s'>&quot;../jquery.js&quot;</span><span class='nt'>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span class='nt'>&lt;script </span><span class='na'>language=</span><span class='s'>&quot;javascript&quot;</span> <span class='na'>type=</span><span class='s'>&quot;text/javascript&quot;</span> <span class='na'>src=</span><span class='s'>&quot;../jquery.flot.js&quot;</span><span class='nt'>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Note: In the above snippet the href values are likely to be different in your case. The second code snippet is simply a single line of HTML that is the div that is to be the Multi-series Bar Graph. It is key that this div has an id that is easily referenced and a set height and width. An example of this snippet is as follows:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='html'><span class='nt'>&lt;div</span> <span class='na'>id=</span><span class='s'>&quot;placeholder&quot;</span> <span class='na'>style=</span><span class='s'>&quot;width: 375px; height: 200px;&quot;</span><span class='nt'>&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The third code snippet needed is the javascript that defines the data, creates the Multi-series Bar Graph in the specified div, and handles the hover functionality. An example of this is seen below.</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='html'><span class='nt'>&lt;script </span><span class='na'>id=</span><span class='s'>&quot;source&quot;</span><span class='nt'>&gt;</span>

    <p>I have been working on a side project for a bit now called We&#8217;reSICC (We are Sound Image Community &amp; Collaboration). It planned to be an online service that is specifically designed to allow music artists and graphic artists to come together and collaborate to create music merchandise. The idea is that We&#8217;reSICC will provide a community and the necessary tools for Musicians and Graphic Artists to collaborate easily to produce merchandise and also provide the necessary tools for both Musicians and Graphic Artists to sell the products. The business model is simply that each party involved gets a chunk of the each sales profit. Anyways, thats enough lead in on that project you will find more about it later.</p>

<p>The reason I mentioned We&#8217;reSICC is because we recently started porting the Django code base over to Google App Engine. We soon found that it lacked support for the standard database migration support that is generally necessary when developing an application of this magnitude. Hence, after searching long and hard I came to the conclusion that I would have to throw together the basis for implementing Lazy Migrations for Google App Engine Models. Hence, I did and then handed a version with very basic functionality off to Patrick Murphy to flesh out further. Patrick Murphy is a software engineer friend of mine that is also working on We&#8217;reSICC. He has written a very nice blog post here that explains how these Lazy Google App Engine Model Migrations and provided all the code you need to get started with it. We like to give back to the community that has given so much to us, :-).</p>

<p>If you are interested in simply learning more about Patrick Murphy then by all means check out his blog <a href='http://codekittens.wordpress.com/'>here</a>.</p>

    <p>Hi all. Recently I was working on a web application that utilized JavaScript and AJAX. Who would have guessed. Anyways, I ran into a bit of a snag when I had the AJAX requests result defining a JavaScript snippet. The problem was that AJAX requests strip out script tags and don&#8217;t let them get inserted into the DOM tree. I am not sure why this is the case, maybe for some security reason that I have yet to see. Anyways, this creates a bit of a problem when you are trying to do things like use a JavaScript calendar widget inside the AJAX result set when the calendar widget needs to be initialized by some JavaScript code that is unique to that calendar.</p>

<p>Despite all my efforts in googling I failed to find a clearly defined solution. Bits of the sites have clues but none of them had actual solutions with enough detail to make it reproducible. Hence, after exploring all of these hints and all of the combinations of the hints I managed to find a working solution for using JavaScript that is dynamically generated as part of the result of an AJAX call.</p>

<p>Lets assume that you are using Prototype because I was, and it is a very common AJAX JavaScript library. The first thing I looked to find out was if there was an event fired off to the portion that is generated by AJAX request. The answer is, not that I could find. There are events in the top level document but none which really help you. Since, there are no events or callbacks in the child document (one produced by the ajax call and loaded into the top level) and no script tags carried through to the top level document we first have to figure out a way to get the JavaScript code to the top level document and then secondarily have JavaScript evaluate it.</p>

<p>In order to get the script tags content to the top level document I had to create a div that contained the raw content of the script tag that I wanted available. Beyond that the div had to have a unique ID that was able to be obtained programatically in the top level document using JavaScript. An example of this might look as follows (html.erb template of JavaScript):</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='html'>  <span class='nt'>&lt;div</span> <span class='na'>id=</span><span class='s'>&quot;&lt;%= calendar_id %&gt;_script&quot;</span> <span class='na'>style=</span><span class='s'>&quot;display: none;&quot;</span><span class='nt'>&gt;</span>;
  <span class='err'>&lt;</span>%= calendar_id %&gt;SelectHandler = function(type, args, obj){
    var selected = args[0];
    var selDate = selected[0][0] + &quot;-&quot; + selected[0][1] + &quot;-&quot; + selected[0][2];
    <span class='err'>&lt;</span>% if txt_input_id.nil? %&gt;
      document.getElementById(&quot;<span class='err'>&lt;</span>%= calendar_namespace %&gt;_<span class='err'>&lt;</span>%= calendar_id %&gt;&quot;).value = selDate;
      <span class='err'>&lt;</span>%= calendar_id %&gt;hide();
    <span class='err'>&lt;</span>% else %&gt;
      document.getElementById(&quot;<span class='err'>&lt;</span>%= txt_input_id %&gt;&quot;).value = selDate;
      <span class='err'>&lt;</span>%= calendar_id %&gt;hide();
    <span class='err'>&lt;</span>% end %&gt;
  }

  <span class='err'>&lt;</span>%= calendar_id %&gt;show = function (){
    var cur_z = $(&#39;<span class='err'>&lt;</span>%= calendar_container %&gt;&#39;).style.zIndex;
    if (!cur_z) {
      cur_z = 1;
    } else {
      cur_z = parseInt(cur_z);
    }
    $(&#39;<span class='err'>&lt;</span>%= calendar_container %&gt;&#39;).show();
    $(&#39;<span class='err'>&lt;</span>%= calendar_container %&gt;&#39;).style.zIndex = (cur_z + 1);
  }

  <span class='err'>&lt;</span>%= calendar_id %&gt;hide = function(){
    var cur_z = $(&#39;<span class='err'>&lt;</span>%= calendar_container %&gt;&#39;).style.zIndex;
    if (!cur_z) {
      cur_z = 1;
    } else {
      cur_z = parseInt(cur_z);
    }
    $(&#39;<span class='err'>&lt;</span>%= calendar_container %&gt;&#39;).hide();
    $(&#39;<span class='err'>&lt;</span>%= calendar_container %&gt;&#39;).style.zIndex = (cur_z - 1);
  }

  YAHOO.namespace(&quot;<span class='err'>&lt;</span>%= calendar_namespace %&gt;.<span class='err'>&lt;</span>%= calendar_id %&gt;&quot;);
  YAHOO.<span class='err'>&lt;</span>%= calendar_namespace %&gt;.<span class='err'>&lt;</span>%= calendar_id %&gt;.init = function() {
    YAHOO.<span class='err'>&lt;</span>%= calendar_namespace %&gt;.<span class='err'>&lt;</span>%= calendar_id %&gt;.Cal = new YAHOO.widget.Calendar(&quot;<span class='err'>&lt;</span>%= calendar_id %&gt;&quot;,&quot;<span class='err'>&lt;</span>%= calendar_container %&gt;&quot;, <span class='err'>&lt;</span>%= @opts %&gt;);

    YAHOO.<span class='err'>&lt;</span>%= calendar_namespace %&gt;.<span class='err'>&lt;</span>%= calendar_id %&gt;.Cal.selectEvent.subscribe(<span class='err'>&lt;</span>%= calendar_id %&gt;SelectHandler, YAHOO.<span class='err'>&lt;</span>%= calendar_namespace %&gt;.<span class='err'>&lt;</span>%= calendar_id %&gt;.Cal, true);
    YAHOO.<span class='err'>&lt;</span>%= calendar_namespace %&gt;.<span class='err'>&lt;</span>%= calendar_id %&gt;.Cal.render();
  }
<span class='nt'>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>This div with a unique id gives me the capability of pulling out the associated raw JavaScript that is the innerHTML content of this div in the top level document and having the top level documents JavaScript evaluate it. This can be done with a JavaScript function like the following:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='html'>function createRowEditCalendar(id) {
  var script = document.getElementById(&quot;cal_visited_on_&quot; + id + &quot;_script&quot;).innerHTML;
  eval(script);
  var my_init_cmd = &quot;YAHOO.namespace_o_hell.cal_visited_on_&quot; + id + &quot;.init();&quot;;
  eval(my_init_cmd);
  return true;
}
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The next logical question of course is what event or callback launches the above JavaScript function in the top level document. The answer in this case is simply to use the Prototypes Ajax.Updater onComplete callback by having it first programatically figure out the name of the div using the reproducible naming scheme and then call the above JavaScript function passing it the necessary id to access the hidden JavaScript div. This might look something like the following:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='html'><span class='nt'>&lt;input</span> <span class='na'>type=</span><span class='s'>&quot;button&quot;</span> <span class='na'>id=</span><span class='s'>&quot;rowedit_create_button&quot;</span> <span class='na'>value=</span><span class='s'>&quot;Create&quot;</span> <span class='na'>onclick=</span><span class='s'>&quot;new Ajax.Updater(&lt;% if prefix %&gt; &#39;&lt;%= prefix %&gt;_rowedit_data_rows&#39; &lt;% else %&gt; &#39;rowedit_data_rows&#39; &lt;% end %&gt;, &#39;&lt;%= urls[:create] %&gt;&#39;, {asynchronous:true, parameters:$(&lt;% if prefix %&gt; &#39;&lt;%= prefix %&gt;_rowedit_create_form&#39; &lt;% else %&gt; &#39;rowedit_create_form&#39; &lt;% end %&gt;).serialize(), insertion: Insertion.Bottom, onComplete: function() { var drows = document.getElementById(&#39;rowedit_data_rows&#39;); var last_row_id = drows.lastChild.id; last_row_id = last_row_id.replace(&#39;edit_&#39;, &#39;&#39;); last_row_id = last_row_id.replace(&#39;_row&#39;, &#39;&#39;); createRowEditCalendar(last_row_id); } });&quot;</span><span class='nt'>/&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Assuming that you have those three components in place and properly setup with all the syntax correct you should have a working solution. Note: Be very careful of syntax errors in the JavaScript inside the eval() method because FireBug won&#8217;t detect them, or run-time errors in the JavaScript anywhere because not all of them will be detected by FireBug. Anyways, hope this helps someone out there, it sure would have helped me if I had it.</p>

    <p>Hi all. If you don&#8217;t know already I have been playing with some iPhone app development pretty heavy lately. One of the interesting things which was some what more difficult to find was how to create a loading screens in iPhone apps. After I bit of googling and some reading of different forums I finally narrowed it down. It is handled automatically if you simply created a PNG file called Default.png that is 320 x 240 pixels with a 160 ppi and place it in your projects Resources file. Once in you Resources it will be displayed during the time that the application is loading. If you need to extend the time to get your splash screen to stay on the screen because your code is god like and fast simply tack a sleep or something in your applicationDidFinishLaunching method.</p>

    <p>Hello all. I have been using Trac for many years now and I have always had one issue with. Creation of large numbers of tickets, large numbers being 10 to 20. The interface just doesn&#8217;t make it easy. So early this evening I finally decided I was going to do something about it. So, I went to <a href='http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/XmlRpcPlugin'>http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/XmlRpcPlugin</a> and checkout out and installed the code on one of our Trac servers. Then, I wrote a simple python wxWidgets script that connects via XML RPC to the Trac environment and provides a much quicker and easier interface for creating large numbers of tickets.</p>

<p>The interface simply provides a milestone dropdown and then a textbox and that is it. Once you have selected a milestone you want the tickets to be associated with (generally a batch of tickets is associated with a milestone), you can type your ticket summary into the text box and simply press enter to create the ticket. Once you press enter and it creates the ticket it will clear the text box so that you can type the next ticket summary in and hit enter to create the next ticket.</p>

<p>Soon enough I will clean this script up and officially release it as on an open source app on the main site. If you are interested in this app before that time, feel free to hit me up.</p>

    <p>I just threw together a screencast that covers a little TextMate Bundle I have been working. The TextMate Autotools Bundle is an extension for the TextMate editor which integrates TextMate with the standard GNU Autotools suite with a specific emphasis on cross-platform building. Check it out below to see the features and how to use them in this alpha version.</p>
