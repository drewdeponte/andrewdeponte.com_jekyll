    <p>Well, I am back with some more updates on my <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard'>Sublime Text 2 Guard Plugin</a>. This is a smaller release than the last as I have been very busy. Despite its small stature it is an exciting one as we have another contribution to honor. The following are the recent updates:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed comma, single quote, question mark color issues (<a href='https://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/25'>#25</a>)</li>

<li>Fixed small color issue caused by <code>!</code> char (<a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/26'>#26</a>)</li>

<li>Better console colors, change <code>0 failures</code> from red to green (Thanks <a href='http://github.com/lidanh'>@lidanh</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>A special thanks goes out to <a href='http://github.com/lidanh'>@lidanh</a> for the code contribution. The new colors are much nicer and the <code>0 failures</code> being green instead of red makes it easier to detect success vs failure.</p>

<p>Thanks also goes out to all the users of the <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard'>Sublime Text 2 Guard Plugin</a>. Especially, the users that have been submitting bug reports and feature requests. This plugin wouldn&#8217;t exist without the direction and feedback from you all.</p>

<p>Please continue to provide feedback via Sublime Text 2 Guard Plugin <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues'>issues</a> on our GitHub page.</p>

    <p>Relatively recently I switched to ZSH for my shell. The primary reason I switched was that I had more flexibility in prompts as I can setup a right prompt and a left prompt. I also like the completion interfacing that ZSH provides. Anyways, I finally got around to generalizing my ZSH setup and makeing it available on GitHub as a backup for myself so that I can easily set it up again in the future, as well as a means of sharing my setup with all of you. Anyways, it is availabe on GitHub at <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/dotzsh'>http://github.com/cyphactor/dotzsh</a> with instructions on how to install it using git.</p>

    <p>So, as some of you may know I pulled my old .vimrc out of hiding and started playing around with vim again to see if I would potentially want to switch back to it from Sublime Text 2. The reason being that I still fealt I was missing something that I had in vim (the quick keyboard navigation and general flexibility). Anyways, I pulled my .vimrc out and added the basics of what I think I am going to need for it to be an acceptable replacement for Sublime Text 2. This includes fuzzy file search, tab completion, etc. Basically all the things necessary for it to be a competitor to Sublime Text 2 in my mind. It isn&#8217;t perferct yet but it is a start.</p>

<p>Note: The only reason I am doing this is because I already knew VIM so I don&#8217;t have a learning curve to really explore this. In my eyes Sublime Text 2 and VIM are pretty damn close in terms of functionality but Sublime Text 2 provides a much smaller learning curve for the majority of people.</p>

<p>This does NOT mean that I am giving up on Sublime Text 2 or that I am going to stop supporting my Sublime Text 2 plugins. If it comes to that at some point in the future I will find a new mantainer for them and let you all know.</p>

<p>Anyways, I have made my vim setup available on github via <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/dotvim'>http://github.com/cyphactor/dotvim</a>. The README for the repository provides instructions on how to install using git.</p>

    <p>Well, I got some more updates for you all.</p>

<p>My Sublime Text 2 Guard Plugin has recently been recognized as an essential Sublime Text 2 plugin on a nettuts+ blog post. Thanks to this publicity and the exposure via Package Control, Twitter, GitHub, and Google I have gotten some decent feedback, especially around my recent addition of colored output. Thanks to all that feedback I have pushed out the following improvements to the Sublime Text 2 Guard Plugin:</p>

<ul>
<li>Support for directory paths with spaces (<a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/pull/19'>#19</a>, Thanks <a href='http://github.com/ffmike'>@ffmike</a>)</li>

<li>Fixed dash based coloring issue (<a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/16'>#16</a>)</li>

<li>Fixed single quote based coloring issue (<a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/17'>#17</a>)</li>

<li>Fixed question mark based coloring issue (<a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/20'>#20</a>)</li>

<li>Fixed period based coloring issue (<a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/21'>#21</a>)</li>

<li>Fixed success dot section identification &amp; coloring issue (<a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/22'>#22</a>)</li>

<li>Fixed a second single quote based coloring issue (<a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/23'>#23</a>)</li>

<li>Added command relativity (<a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/24'>#24</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The above break down of improvements include primarily a bunch of coloring fixes, command relativity, and one very important issue that deserves some recognition, issue <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/pull/19'>#19</a> by <a href='http://github.com/ffmike'>@ffmike</a>. This is the Sublime Text 2 Guard Plugin&#8217;s first contribution. Much thanks goes out to <a href='http://github.com/ffmike'>@ffmike</a> for being our first contributor.</p>

<p>As usual if any of you have identified bugs or features that you would like added please submit them on the GitHub Issues page for the <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues?sort=created&amp;direction=desc&amp;state=open'>Sublime Text 2 Guard Plugin</a>.</p>

    <p>Hey all,</p>

<p>I know there are a number of you who have been eagerly awaiting this moment. I sure have been. I am proud to announce the first release of the <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard'>Sublime Text 2 Guard Plugin</a> that provides colored output. Basically, it ended up that I had to define a language file to identify the entities in the output and then define a theme to color those identified entities. Once, I did that I simply programatically set the color_scheme and syntax options for the output panel and like magic colors worked. Given the complexity of the language definition and the limited test cases I had when developing I am sure there are going to be some bugs to work out. So, as usual please create issues if you find any of these <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues'>issues</a>.</p>
