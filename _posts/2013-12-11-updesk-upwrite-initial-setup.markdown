## Backstory

Over the last few years I have been paying more and more attention to
ergonamics in my workspace. It all began when I started having issues with
my wrists and given I am a software developer I need my hands to work
properly. This sent me down a path of exploring ergonomic keyboards and
standing desks. I started trying out the cheaper ergonomic keyboards and
never had any luck. Enter the Kinesis Advantage Pro, I finally decided to drop
a chunk of change on it and I really haven't looked back. My next exploration
will be the ErgoDox which I recently ordered all the parts for.

A little bit before I switched to the Kinesis Advantage Pro I switched to a
fixed height standing desk which I bought from Ikea for approx. $150. I have
been using the fixed height standing desk for over a year now and I love it.
However, the more research I do around the topic the more I have found that it
isn't good to stand all day, which is what I currently do. Therefore, I
started looking into motorized standing/sitting desks. After a lot of
research I finally decided on the [UpDesk
UpWrite](http://myupdesk.com/upwrite).  It is at the lower end of the price
range, $1,149.00, for motorized standing/sitting desks but it has the specs of
a lot of the more expensive alternatives. It also has the added benefit that
it is a dry erase/wet erase surface so you can scribble notes on it while
working.

## The Setup

### Putting it Together

My [UpDesk UpWrite](http://myupdesk.com/upwrite) arrived tonight and it was
actually very straightforward in terms of physical setup. The included
instruction sheet explained things very well. It is actually much simpler in
my opinion than most Ikea furniture. It probably took me 25 mins to get it
put together. I was extremely impressed with the quality of packaging and the
quality of the parts them selves. It seems to be an extremely solid piece of
furniture that will last a long time.

### Initializing and Calibrating

Once I physically setup the desk I tried to initialize it and callibrate it.
Initializing the desk was very straightforward on their instruction sheet and
worked like a champ. Calibrating it on the other hand did not work following
the instructions they provide. The instructions for calibration that were
provided are as follows:

* At any height, measure the distance from the floor to the top of the desk.
* Press both the "UP" and "DOWN" arrows at the same time until the display
  shows three bars (---).
* Release and immediately set the correct height by pressing either the "UP"
  or "DOWN" arrow until the correct height is displayed.

I tried the above steps numerous times and every time I got to the third step
and pressed the "UP" or "DOWN" arrows to adjust the displayed height it would
also move the desk up or down which made no sense if the goal of the process
was to callibrate the height.

So, it took a little playing around but I finally figured out how to properly
callibrate it. The directions to calibrate it should really be as follows:

* At any height, measure the distance from the floor to the top of the desk.
* Press and hold both the "UP" and "DOWN" arrows at the same time, the display
  will immediately display three bars (---), continue to hold the "UP" and
  "DOWN" arrows until the display flashes from (---) to the displayed height.
* Release and immediately set the display to height you previously measured in
  the first step by pressing either the "UP" or "DOWN" arrow until the correct
  height is displayed.

### Dialing in Presets

Once I had it all calibrated I followed the rest of the instructions to set
the presets to heights that I like for standing and sitting. All worked great.

## Conclusion

So far the [UpDesk UpWrite](https://myupdesk.com/upwrite) seems like a great
desk. It was a little frustrating that the directions weren't clear enough, or
rather just plain wrong, for how to calibrate it. However, I am willing to
look past that small hickup and I hope this blog aids others in getting their
desks calibrated quicker than I did.
