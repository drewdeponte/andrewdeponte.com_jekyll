  <section>
    <p>Today, was a busy day as usual in the life of Drew. Aly and I woke up relatively early and decided that it was time to work on the backyard planter. It was in severe need of ripping out plants and weeding. So, Aly and I got our tools together and went to work cutting, chopping, digging, trimming, weeding, pruning, and jumping up and down in the natural waste garbage can, trying to get all of the stuff to fit.</p>

<p>It was quite involved as we removed the three largest bushes from the planter. These bushes had root systems like I have never seen before. Some of them went almost the entire length of the planter. Anyways, we did that till about 1:00 pm and then I started some more demo work behind the fridge for the gas pipes so that I could get a proper measurements before we went to Subway for lunch and then to, you guessed it, Home Depot.</p>

<p>Once we got to Home Depot we went and gathered all of the black iron pipe pieces we needed to get the gas piping done up to the laundry room. Beyond that we got some ground cover bark for the planter that we started working on. Once we got back Aly focused on picking the many river rocks out of the planter that the previous home owners put in there for some reason. While she was working on the planter I started working on notching out studs, drilling holes in studs and other framing so that I could run the pipe through the wall cavity in as few pieces as possible. As always the more connections you have the more possibility there is for leakage. Hence, I always try to get pipes done in the fewest number of joints.</p>

<p>It took us roughly till about 8:00 pm tonight to get the gas piping done up to the laundry room and get the planter decently cleaned out. You can see pictures of the results of our hard work <a href='http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.535700065920.2048929.30901409&amp;type=3&amp;l=240a1dad70'>here</a>.</p>

  <section>
    <p>Today was one of those days where I woke up and something was just off with respect to my workflow for some reason. I was frustrated with the fact that I had to load a browser and go to a website to see what my tickets were for the day. Instinctively I just wanted my tickets to magically be in my head so I didn&#8217;t have to go through all those steps. So, I started thinking about this problem more and more as the day went by and I came to the conclusion that I really have two problems.</p>

<ol>
<li>I have tickets dispersed through multiple ticketing system.</li>

<li>I hate having to go through so many steps to see my tickets.</li>
</ol>

<p>When I started thinking about my two problems I realized that I have my tickets in roughly four different applications/services. These applications/services are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href='http://trac.edgewall.org/'>Trac</a> - Web based project management/task management tool</li>

<li><a href='http://lighthouseapp.com/'>Lighthouse</a> - Web based project management/task management tool</li>

<li><a href='http://github.com/'>GitHub</a> - Web based Git repository management system and issue tracking tool</li>

<li><a href='http://culturedcode.com/things/'>Things</a> - Desktop task management system</li>
</ul>

<p>Beyond having multiple ticket sources, most of them have multiple accounts for various reasons (contract jobs I have done, etc.). Being in a specific environment while working within that scope/environment is fine. For example if I am working on Project X it makes sense that I be in project X&#8217;s environment. However, the situation that I am frustrated with is the initialization and transition periods which exist before you start working on a project and when you are switching from one project to the next project.</p>

<p>Based on my issues and the situation I am frustrated with I have come up with a small set of requirements for a solution. These requirements are listed below.</p>

<ol>
<li>Tickets from all ticket sources must exist in a dashboard</li>

<li>This dashboard must require zero effort/steps to view it</li>

<li>This dashboard must automatically update with zero effort/steps</li>
</ol>

<p>As many of you know despite the fact that I write software for various platforms and in various languages my platform for development is generally Mac OS X. Given that Mac OS X was my environment, I started thinking about this requirement set and thinking about how I could make something that required zero effort/steps to view it. The closest thing I could come up with was having my tickets displayed on my desktop. After a few minutes of googling based on that idea I found an awesome tool for Mac OS X called <a href='http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/'>GeekTool</a>. Among other things, <a href='http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/'>GeekTool</a> will run shell scripts/console applications for you on a set frequency and display their output to a defined section of your desktop. This was perfect in my opinion so I played with it for a few minutes and decide that I was going to use <a href='http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/'>GeekTool</a>.</p>

<p>Given the functionality of <a href='http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/'>GeekTool</a> all that was really left was to write shell scripts/console applications that output all of my tickets from the various ticket sources and I would have a very quick and functional solution to my issue. Hence, I got to writing and pumped out the following short little Ruby scripts, and one AppleScript script to provide output of all my tickets from the various sources.</p>

<p>The following is a ruby script that pulls all my tickets in from all of my various <a href='http://lighthouseapp.com/'>Lighthouse</a> accounts and projects.</p>

<p>After coding the above scripts I simply set them up through the <a href='http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/'>GeekTool</a> UI and like magic within 15 mins or so I had a working solution to my issue, thanks to the power of REST based Web Services, Ruby, the Ruby Community, and Things AppleScript integration.

    <p>Today was the 3rd and final day of installation for this batch of windows which in total included 8 windows, one 4 pane 10 foot sliding glass door, framing a door way in, and doing all the stucco work. When C &amp; M Windows got here the day began with a bunch of prep work for doing detail work and stucco.</p>

<p>Once they performed all the prep work they did the finish work on the inside of the sliding glass doors. This consisted of ripping some small pieces of wood to account for the thickness of the plaster because the Milgard Sliders are sizes the standard width of a 2x4 and therefore require that you put filler in the gap to finish it. Once they cut &amp; installed all the pieces using a micro nailer they starting with the molding. By the way micro nailers are bitchin. I am going to have to acquire one at some point soon, :-). It was interesting to see them measure and cut the molding because they didn&#8217;t measure it. They simply placed the first piece and marked it according to the door frame. They then cut that piece and one end of the top piece, placed it, dry fitted it, and then marked it on the right side. They then proceeded to cut that piece and proceeded with the same process with the right piece. This technique produced a much better result than jobs I have seen done in the past where they simply measured.</p>

<p>Anyways once they finished installing the molding they caulked it and then moved on to anchoring the framed in door to the concrete and then began the stucco process. During my lunch break today they were kind enough to give me a quick course in stuccoing. It is very similar in technique and process to that of mudding which I have as of recent become pretty damn comfortable with. Anyways, they ended up doing the single coat of scratch &amp; brown coat combo to bring the stucco out pretty much even around the door. They mixed in roughly 1/3 rd Mortar Mix with the Quickreet scratch &amp; brown coat combo mix to increase the setting time to roughly 20 mins.</p>

<p>After finishing that they went and did the scratch coat on the area where they framed in the door. The scratch coat was the same mixture but they did it as a slightly thinner batch (more water) so that it would mix in with the lath better. Once that started to set a tiny bit they scratched it and went back to the door and cleaned up the stucco as it is much easier to clean up if you let it set a little bit because it won&#8217;t pull the stucco out when you edge it off. Anyways, they then went back and loaded and floated the brown coat on the framed in door and feathered it to blend it with the existing stucco. Once it was all even they let that set for a bit and started mixing the color coat which they had a chart that let them know what color coats to mix to produce the closest color stucco. Then they mixed that which was a much thinner batch compared to the scratch and brown. Beyond that, they did NOT mix in the mortar mix this time. They simply used the straight up color coat with some water as usual.</p>

<p>Anyways, they finished the color coats and cleaned up the stucco here and there after they let it set a bit and then did finishing touches on cleaning up the doors and removing the tap and cover from the slider as well as just doing general cleanup. And that was it, my doors were installed I wrote the check for the final payment and like magic I have amazing new windows and a slider and got a lesson in stucco.</p>

<p>Checkout the results <a href='http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.535699916220.2048928.30901409&amp;type=3&amp;l=354c6d171b'>here</a>.</p>

    <p>Today was yet another exciting day. C &amp; M Windows came back for the second day of my new windows installation. The plan for today was for them to get my new 10 foot 4 pane sliding door framed in and installed with the necessary weather proofing minus the stucco and finish work on the inside. The other object that they set out to complete today was framing in the side door to the area which is now going to become an indoor laundry room so that I don&#8217;t have go out to the garage to do laundry.</p>

<p>C &amp; M Windows managed to accomplish both of these tasks today within reasonable amount of time and were a pleasure to have around the house as usual. Last night when I was attempting to fall asleep it was amazing to notice the difference in the amount of sound now that all the new dual pane windows have been installed vs. the old single pane windows. Tonight, thus far has been even quieter as the sliding door has been installed. Beyond that the temperature difference between the house and the outside is much better now.</p>

<p>They worked on the slider framing and installation first and then proceeded to frame in the door and prep it with necessary moisture barriers and lath so that tomorrow they could mix the stucco and do the all the stucco in one session and finish work in one session. I can&#8217;t wait for tomorrow to come and to see the results of all this work and money.</p>

<p>If you are interested in seeing the results of today click <a href='http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.535699781490.2048927.30901409&amp;type=3&amp;l=19a3bc4d10'>here</a>. I included pictures of both new slider and the side door where you can see the flashing, moisture barrier, and the lath that will receive the scratch, brown, and color coat of stucco tomorrow.</p>

    <p>Hey Boys &amp; Girls, Today was definitely a very eventful day. Beyond the normal work stuff, like conference calls all day, one very interesting thing happened in my life today. Today, was Day 1 of the installation of my new Windows by a small company called C&amp;M Windows. As those of you that are close to me know, I am in a mode of supporting small businesses lately and C&amp;M Construction (I think they also DBA as C&amp;M Windows) is definitely one that is at the top of my list. I can not recommend them strongly enough for any Window or Door needs you might have. Anyways, they have very low overhead because they are such a small business so they can usually beat everyone else&#8217;s quotes. Beyond that they are just awesome people and do great work!</p>

<p>Anyways, I orded 8 Milgard windows and 1 sliding glass door through them and they came out today and installed the 8 windows. They got here a tad bit earlier than 9:00 am and and managed to get all 8 windows installed by roughly 3:00 pm. They are coming back tomorrow to do the installation of the sliding glass door and do a bit of framing work and stucco work for me. You can see the pictures of the 8 windows that were replaced today <a href='http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.535699377300.2048926.30901409&amp;type=3&amp;l=fa386bcc77'>here</a>. Beyond the windows you will see the slider that is going to be replaced tomorrow and the side door that is going to be framed in and stuccoed tomorrow. You will see the difference between the old and new believe me, :-).</p>

<p>Anyways, I am super excited that I have nice windows in my house now. It feels so much better already and there is more to come tomorrow. I am like a little kid on Christmas morning. Anyways, just figured I would share it with all of you.</p>
