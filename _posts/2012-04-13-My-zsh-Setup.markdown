Relatively recently I switched to ZSH for my shell. The primary reason I
switched was that I had more flexibility in prompts as I can setup a right
prompt and a left prompt. I also like the completion interfacing that ZSH
provides. Anyways, I finally got around to generalizing my ZSH setup and
makeing it available on GitHub as a backup for myself so that I can easily set
it up again in the future, as well as a means of sharing my setup with all of
you. Anyways, it is availabe on GitHub at [http://github.com/cyphactor/dotzsh](http://github.com/cyphactor/dotzsh)
with instructions on how to install it using git.
