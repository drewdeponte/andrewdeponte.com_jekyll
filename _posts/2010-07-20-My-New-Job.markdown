Hey all. I know its been a while since my last post. But, life has been a
little crazy. I recently took a position at a new company called
[RealPractice](http://realpractice.com) heading up the software engineering
team that is responsible for all of their new products. I am very excited to
start up a new team and build some amazing software. I can't wait to get
started building a strong team that builds even stronger software.

I have a feeling that this will put a bit of a slow down into the progress on
the house. But, this is what I love doing, so I think it is worth it. This may
also for a temporary period of time also slow down my rate of posting with
respect to software tid-bits. But, I will come back stronger than ever with
more stuff to post about.
