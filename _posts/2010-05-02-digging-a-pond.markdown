Today, I woke up and realized that yesterday we neglected to take the stump of
the biggest of the three plants out of the planter. Therefore, I decided that I
was going to remove the stump and all of its roots. After digging it and all of
its roots out there was already a huge hole and a large portion of the planter
had been dug up. During my Mom's last visit she had mentioned that I should put
a pond in the corner of the planter where this biggest bush previously resided.

So, after looking at the results of removing the bush Aly and I decided that we
might as well just finish the job and dig a hole for the pond in the corner.
Hence, I dug... and dug... and dug... for hours in the baking sun. Actually, it
felt good to be doing some physical labor and the weather was pretty decent.
Anyways, I dug it up and started the basics of the framing of the pond and its
various tiers. 

Check out the results of my effort

P.S. - The finished part of the planter was all thanks to the hard work of my
Mom during her last visit. Wench, I love you! Thanks for your help.
