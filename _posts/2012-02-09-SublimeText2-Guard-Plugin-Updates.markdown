Hey all,

My Sublime Text 2 Guard plugin has been out for a couple weeks now and it has
definitely gotten some more usage under its belt. Thanks to everyone for your
usage and feedback. As a result of the feedback and user generated issues I
have released a new version to tighten it up a bit both from a user experience
stand point as well as a stability standpoint. This release includes the
following:

* Now installable via [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control)
* Fixed Guard won't start when installled via Package Control ([issue #11](http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/11))
* Added auto show output feature ([issue #12](http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/12))
* Replaced `#!/bin/sh` with `#!/bin/bash` in internal scripts

For info on how to get the latest version or how to report bugs, feature
requsts, etc. Please check out the GitHub page for the [sublime_guard](http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard) project.
