When I took over the software engineering team at my job. I had the opportunity
to start fresh with a new ticketing, bug tracking, and project management
toolset. Over, the years I have used a number of different tools most recently
Trac and Lighthouse. However, I can go on and on with the tools that I have
tried. When, I came on board they were currently using Jira which I know is big
in certain communities, however, everyone seemed to hate it and I have a bunch
of issues with it that I don't want to get into. Anyways, so I spent some time
and reviewed the following project management and ticketing systems again to
just get a refresher and see where they were at and if any of them would work
for me and my team.

* Redmine - [http://www.redmine.org/](http://www.redmine.org/)
* Basecamp - [http://basecamphq.com/](http://basecamphq.com/)
* Devalot - [http://projects.noscience.net/devalot](http://projects.noscience.net/devalot)
* ProjectPier - [http://www.projectpier.org/](http://www.projectpier.org/)
* Trac - [http://trac.edgewall.org/](http://trac.edgewall.org/)
* Jira - [http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/](http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/)
* Collabtive - [http://collabtive.o-dyn.de/](http://collabtive.o-dyn.de/)
* eGroupWare - [http://www.egroupware.org/Home](http://www.egroupware.org/Home)

So after heavy review of each of the above listed project management tools I
decided on Redmine because it is hugely flexible, has a decent community behind
it. It does have what I would consider some usability issues and some major
design issues in the UI. However, once you learn those it is pretty much
capable of everything I need it to do. When, you look at other solutions they
all seem to be lacking very important features.
