I know its a been a while since I made my last update about the progress on my
house. I have been super busy with the house and a few other projects I have
going on, not to mention my full time Job, :-). However, this weekend I manage
to get quite a bit done. Probably, the most significant thing was the fact that
I dug up over 4 inches of dirt for the entire backyard and put new soil down
with furtilizer and laid some fresh sod down. My backyard actually is starting
to look like a backyard. It feels so much better.

Secondly, I ripped out a wall, reframed it, and framed in another White Lami
Pocket Door in the front bedroom. Hence, the closet now has a White Lami Pocket
Door and so does the bathroom that is connected to the front bedroom. Seeing,
the two White Lami doors hanging side by side helps me realize that my vision
for this room is finally coming together.

Beyond, those feets I have been spending some time looking at fixtures for the
bathroom that is attached to the front bedroom because the next step is really
putting the plumbing for the fixtures in. Once, that is done I can drywall and
tile the bathroom and the bedroom and put the fixtures in. Anyways, its coming
together and I was definitely happy with the progress I made this weekend.
