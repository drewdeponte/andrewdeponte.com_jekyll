Just to let you all know. I finally found a media manager/player for Mac OS X
that supports practically every file format including iTunes DRM based media
files. Beyond that, it lets you play the web which is freaking amazing. It is
something you have to see to believe. Check it out at the
[birdnest](http://songbirdnest.com/). Beyond that it is cross-platform so it
works on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. It is currently only available by
developer pre-release which is pretty functional as it is. It will be even more
amazing as time goes on. A simple glance at their screencast on their site will
show you what it is all about and how it works in general.
