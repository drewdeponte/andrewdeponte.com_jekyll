Well, I am back with some more updates on my [Sublime Text 2 Guard
Plugin](http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard).  This is a smaller release
than the last as I have been very busy. Despite its small stature it is an
exciting one as we have another contribution to honor. The following are the
recent updates:

* Fixed comma, single quote, question mark color issues
  ([#25](https://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/25))
* Fixed small color issue caused by `!` char
  ([#26](http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/26))
* Better console colors, change `0 failures` from red to green (Thanks
  [@lidanh](http://github.com/lidanh))

A special thanks goes out to [@lidanh](http://github.com/lidanh) for the code
contribution. The new colors are much nicer and the `0 failures` being green
instead of red makes it easier to detect success vs failure.

Thanks also goes out to all the users of the [Sublime Text 2 Guard
Plugin](http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard).  Especially, the users that
have been submitting bug reports and feature requests. This plugin wouldn't
exist without the direction and feedback from you all.

Please continue to provide feedback via Sublime Text 2 Guard Plugin
[issues](http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues) on our GitHub page.
