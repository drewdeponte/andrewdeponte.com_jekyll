After the hike yesterday I decided that today should be a day for relaxation.
Hence, I took the day off from hiking and went and relaxed at the beach right
next to the resort I am staying at. The beach is known as Nukoli'i Beach. This
is an amazingly beautiful beach. The break has a short drop off which is pretty
densely covered with rocks which helps reduce the number of annoying people on
the beach. The beauty of this beach was amazing as I sipped my Pacifico resting
on the beach from my previous days hike, :-).

I spent the rest of the day enjoying the weather, the beach, and of course the
Pacifico, :-). After, spending my time at Nukoli'i Beach I went back to the
resort and relaxed for a while in the pool and Jacuzzi. While in the pool and
Jacuzzi, guess what I was doing. Yep, you guessed it, drinking more Pacifico.
After this very hard day of relaxation I went back to my condo and slept like I
have never slept before. I figure it must have been the beer that put me to
sleep, :-). Oh, yeah I also did a suspended abs workout at some point. Too bad
the beer eliminated all that work. Hopefully it helped balance it all out,
hehe.
