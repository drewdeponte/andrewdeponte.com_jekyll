So as some you already know I have been crazy busy with work as of late
preparing for the launch of our new product. Hence, I haven't had much time to
work on the house. However, this weekend I finally had some time and decided it
was time to break into the slab of the front shower so that I could replace the
piping that connects to the drain and the piping that connects to the vent. The
following video shows the results of this little adventure.
