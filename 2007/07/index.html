    <p>I woke up early today in L.A. and drove to L.A.X. to catch my flight to the beautiful island of Kauai. After finally boarding the plane and taking off I flew for about an hour, at which point the pilot came on the com system and notified us that there was a problem with one of the window seals in the pilots cabin. It was causing issues with being able to maintain cabin pressure so we then had to turn around and fly back to L.A.X. After making it back to L.A.X. the mechanics crew quickly, within 15 minutes, replaced the seal. Then, we waited about another 45 minutes for the clearance paper work to be filed so we could take off again and restart this venture to Kauai. Finally we took off again and flew non-stop to Kauai only 3 hours late! I arrived at Lihue airport and I couldn&#8217;t have been happier. The humidity and temperature were just right. I got a ride to where I was staying and relaxed the rest of the night after eating. The adventure begins!</p>

    <a href='/images/photos/original/dsc_0052.jpg' target='_blank'><img align='left' src='/images/photos/medium/dsc_0052.jpg' /></a>
<p>Today I hiked to a set of falls known as Waipoo Falls. Waipoo Falls consists of both an upper and lower falls. These falls exist within beautiful Waimea Canyon. The trail to Waipoo Falls goes along the northern rim of the canyon. Along the way there exist a number short trails that lead to amazing viewpoints to take in Waimea Canyon in all of its glory. After following the canyon trails for about 1.2 miles I found the Waipoo Upper Falls. The water narrowed and fell a near 200 feet below into a small pool.</p>
<a href='/images/photos/original/dsc_0058.jpg' target='_blank'><img align='right' src='/images/photos/medium/dsc_0058.jpg' /></a>
<p>After absorbing the peace and tranquility of the upper falls I continued my hike to find the lower falls. I took the right fork which took me to the falls after hiking approximately 0.6 miles. Once, I arrived at the lower falls I decided that there had to be something beyond these amazing falls. So, I got a little bit wet and did a bit of rock climbing to get to the top of the falls and found that yet another trail existed behind the falls which followed an amazingly elegant stream for at least a 1/2 a mile. I then quickly turned around and went back to the lower falls to meet back up with the people I went hiking with.</p>
<a href='/images/photos/original/dsc_0068.jpg' target='_blank'><img align='left' src='/images/photos/medium/dsc_0068.jpg' /></a>
<p>After returning to the lower falls I started hiking back and got to the fork, this time I decided to take the Black Pipe trail back to the vehicle. It is basically a trail which goes the long way around and turns into switch backs going up the side of one if the mountains faces leading back to the original dirt road that went back to the car. At one point the Black Pipe trail looks to dead end, this was the point where the switch backs started. Due to the fact that the Black Pipe trail is a much less traveled trail the grass had over grown the path to the starts of the switch backs which is to the right of the trail end. All and all it was another amazing hike which was in total about 3.5 miles long.</p>

<p>After the hike yesterday I decided that today should be a day for relaxation. Hence, I took the day off from hiking and went and relaxed at the beach right next to the resort I am staying at. The beach is known as Nukoli&#8217;i Beach. This is an amazingly beautiful beach. The break has a short drop off which is pretty densely covered with rocks which helps reduce the number of annoying people on the beach. The beauty of this beach was amazing as I sipped my Pacifico resting on the beach from my previous days hike, :-).</p>
<a href='/images/photos/original/dsc_0091.jpg' target='_blank'><img align='right' src='/images/photos/medium/dsc_0091.jpg' /></a>
<p>I spent the rest of the day enjoying the weather, the beach, and of course the Pacifico, :-). After, spending my time at Nukoli&#8217;i Beach I went back to the resort and relaxed for a while in the pool and Jacuzzi. While in the pool and Jacuzzi, guess what I was doing. Yep, you guessed it, drinking more Pacifico. After this very hard day of relaxation I went back to my condo and slept like I have never slept before. I figure it must have been the beer that put me to sleep, :-). Oh, yeah I also did a suspended abs workout at some point. Too bad the beer eliminated all that work. Hopefully it helped balance it all out, hehe.</p>

    <a href='/images/photos/original/dsc_0119.jpg' target='_blank'><img align='left' src='/images/photos/medium/dsc_0119.jpg' /></a>
<p>As many of you may know. I am currently on the amazing island of Kauai enjoying what has been a quite an amazing and relaxing break from life. Today, I went on a hike to a set of water falls known locally as the Ho&#8217;opi&#8217;i Falls which consists of both an upper and lower falls powered by a decently large fresh water stream. The Ho&#8217;opi&#8217;i Falls are one of the most aggressive set of falls I have seen on Kauai when it comes to thrashing and rate of flow of the water. I started the hike by first finding the old dirt utility road which is a buried pretty deep inside a local neighborhood. After finding the road I hiked about a 1 mile or so back into what is an amazingly beautiful jungle to find the first falls, the upper falls. The upper falls was roughly a 20 ft fall which narrowed all the water causing a powerful flow. So, powerful that if a foot was placed in the water one would be easily swept away. The force and power of the water was quite humbling.</p>
<a href='/images/photos/original/dsc_0125.jpg' target='_blank'><img align='right' src='/images/photos/medium/dsc_0125.jpg' /></a>
<p>After taking in the extraordinary upper fall, I continued my hike further into the jungle for about 1 and 1/2 miles. The further and further I got into the jungle the denser the jungle got and the higher the humidity got. Given the location and the standing pools of water in between the falls, some friends of ours know as the mosquitoes joined me for the hike. I had heard that this hike was known to have mosquitoes so I sprayed Off all over before the hike. However, it did not seem to do any good. Despite the attacking mosquitoes I pushed forward through the jungle eventually finding the lower falls which was even more magnificent than the upper falls. The lower falls was easily a 100 ft drop and opened up allowing the falling water to cascade against a barrage of rocks below.</p>

<p>After spending some time hiking deeper into the jungle to see what I could find, I ran into a dead end where the faint animal trail I was following disappeared and the jungle got very dense. At this point I was frustrated with all the mosquito bites I had received and decided it was time to turn around and hike the approx. 2 1/2 miles back to the car. Despite the mosquitoes the hike was well worth it and provided me with a view of two of the most amazing water falls I have seen on Kauai.</p>

<p>I deemed today, yet another day of relaxation. I spent most of the day once again absorbing the peaceful atmosphere generated by the crashing of the waves on Nukoli&#8217;i Beach. After, spending a few hours on Nukoli&#8217;i Beach I went back to the condo and worked out for about an hour. I can&#8217;t let myself get completely out of shape because I am on vacation, come on! I then went and took a dip in the pool and soaked in the Jacuzzi. After my dip and soak I came back to the condo for some lunch and then ventured back out to Nukoli&#8217;i Beach to enjoy the evening air take a casual stroll down the beach. On my walk I saw hundreds and hundreds of sand crabs ducking and diving in and out of their little holes. After, my lovely walk on the beach I went back to the condo and ate dinner and relaxed some more, :-).</p>

    <a href='/images/photos/original/dsc_0168.jpg' target='_blank'><img align='left' src='/images/photos/medium/dsc_0168.jpg' /></a>
<p>Today on my vacation in Kauai I did two things. First I went on a hike up Nounou Mountain (a.k.a. The Sleeping Giant) and second I moved from a condo I was at on the east side of the island to the condo I normally stay at on the north side of the island. First thing I did was wake up, pack the car, and check out of my condo on the east side of the island. Then, I took a drive to the base of the Nounou Mountain and started a hike up the east side of Nouou Mountain. This trail has the greatest elevation change out of all the trails and is about 2 miles in each direction. The east trail is mainly composed of a <a href='/images/photos/original/dsc_0172.jpg' target='_blank'><img align='right' src='/images/photos/medium/dsc_0172.jpg' /></a> number of switch backs which traverse the mountain. The moist jungle trail continues up to a vista point where a couple benches are setup under a shade and a decent view is available. The vista point is NOT the top of Nounou Mountain. There exists a trail that goes to the peak of Nounou Mountain which is approx. 1,000 ft above the beginning of the trail. This trail is a bit more difficult than the trail up to the benches, though not much. At the very top of Nounou Mountain there is a block marking the peak. A decent view is available once at the peak, however a much better view can be obtained if you take a small trail from the peak to the front of the east plateau. After, enjoying the <a href='/images/photos/original/dsc_0174.jpg' target='_blank'><img align='left' src='/images/photos/medium/dsc_0174.jpg' /></a> view at the east plateau I followed the trail back a ways and peaked through the hole in the giants chin. It is on a small trail that goes to the left of the trail taken to get to the peak. After, deciding that the east plateau view was better I continued my way back down the trail for the second 2 miles completing a 4 mile hike.</p>
<a href='/images/photos/original/dsc_0193.jpg' target='_blank'><img align='right' src='/images/photos/medium/dsc_0193.jpg' /></a>
<p>After the amazing views from the Nounou Mountain hike I drove to the condo I normally stay at on the north end of Kauai. I love the north end of Kauai so much. It just seems like the more north you get the prettier and prettier it gets. Hence the condo I normally stay at overlooks the northern coast of Kauai. On the northern coast there aren&#8217;t as many beaches due to the abundance of cliffs. However, when you are in the mood to relax and take in something unbelievably beautiful this is the place to be. After getting settled in to the new condo I drank a beer while taking in the gorgeous ocean, and then went for a dip in the pool and Jacuzzi. While sitting in the Jacuzzi drinking my brew a security guard came up to me and told me there was no drinking allowed at the pool and that someone called and complained that I was drinking a beer at the <a href='/images/photos/original/dsc_0197.jpg' target='_blank'><img align='left' src='/images/photos/medium/dsc_0197.jpg' /></a> pool. First of all, LAME!, I have been coming to this same condo for years now, all the time drinking beer, and I have never been told that before. In fact they even used to give you drinks for free, pool side. Second of all, who the hell is so bored and has such a pathetic depressing life that they have nothing better to do but sit in their condo looking at the pool and call security when someone is drinking a beer at the Jacuzzi and being totally quiet. However, they did recently get bought out so maybe the rules have changed. Anyways, I will verify the policy tomorrow and continue drinking my beers, :-D.</p>

<p>All in all, it was just another amazing day in &#8220;The Life of Drew&#8221;, on Kauai, :-).</p>

<p>Today was yet another relaxation day. However, instead of spending it on the east coast of Kauai like last time, I spent it at my normal condo on the north coast of Kauai. It rained all of last night and today with some very strong winds. Hence, I spent most of day inside relaxing, designing and writing software, watching movies and TV, playing card games, etc. I did however at one point during a small break in the weather catch a glimpse of the first rainbow I have ever seen exist on the water rather than in the sky. Beyond that, I did find out about the policy on the drinking at the pool and Jacuzzi. Basically, there is no rule that states one can&#8217;t drink at the pool. However, it is required that drinks be kept in plastic cups as to protect against excessive effort required to clean up broken glass in the Jacuzzi or pool. This rule totally makes sense and is beyond acceptable in my opinion. So, in short, I can continue drinking my beers at the pool or Jacuzzi. Thank God! I was really worried for a second there, hehe, :-). Overall today was very nice and quite relaxing.</p>

    <a href='/images/photos/original/dsc_0211.jpg' target='_blank'><img align='left' src='/images/photos/medium/dsc_0211.jpg' /></a>
<p>Today, I slept through what looks to be an amazing sun rise based on the photo the people I am staying with took. That, is ok though, I am glad that I got the extra bit of sleep. After getting up and eating an amazing high fiber cereal for breakfast I took a 3/4 mile hike from the condo down to a place known as Queens Bath. Queens Bath, is supposedly a place where back in the day, the Queen used to come and bath due to the presence of an ocean fed pool.</p>
<a href='/images/photos/original/dsc_0250.jpg' target='_blank'><img align='right' src='/images/photos/medium/dsc_0250.jpg' /></a>
<p>I soon made it to the trail head and continued down a small muddy trail which follows a small creek that dumps into the ocean via a very cool looking water fall. After, making it all the way down the trail it opens up to plateau of lava rock. Following the lava rock to the left takes you to the well known Queens Bath which was very populated by the time I got there. Given that I am all about seclusion I continued hiking past the Queens Bath in hopes that I may find my own personal Kings Bath, :-).</p>
<a href='/images/photos/original/dsc_0238.jpg' target='_blank'><img align='left' src='/images/photos/medium/dsc_0238.jpg' /></a>
<p>After hiking a little ways past the Queens Bath, I saw in the distance another bath that was a bit smaller than Queens Bath. However, it was the perfect size for me and it was totally secluded from all the people enjoying Queens Bath. After, making it over to my &#8220;Kings Bath&#8221; I decided I had to get in. It is slightly tricky to get in to &#8220;Kings Bath&#8221; due to the abundance of sea urchins surrounding the edges of the bath. However, once you are in the bath it is an amazingly refreshing experience in crystal clear ocean water.</p>
<a href='/images/photos/original/dsc_0245.jpg' target='_blank'><img align='right' src='/images/photos/medium/dsc_0245.jpg' /></a>
<p>After enjoying my own private bath, I carefully climbed out of the bath making sure not to disturb the sea urchins and started my hike back to the trail. Once I made it back to the base of the trail I continued hiking to the right side of the trail which people have told me is usually surrounded by sea turtles. Despite the reports of the sea turtles I was not lucky enough to see any. It may have been due to the time that I was hiking at Queens Bath. Despite the fact that I did not see any sea turtles I did enjoy quite an amazing ocean view. After, taking in the view I hiked another 3/4 of a mile back to the condo and took a relaxing dip in the pool. I plan to spend the rest of the day relaxing and enjoying the pool and Jacuzzi at the condo.</p>

<p>Today was a day of complete relaxation. I did absolutely nothing but relax in the pool and Jacuzzi, eat, drink beer, and write software. It was a beautiful day as usual here in paradise. I spent a few hours absorbing the rays and hacking away on my latest projects while sipping on a Pacifico on the lanai. I was very productive and got a lot of project clean up done. For the other half of the day I absorbed more rays while doing laps in the pool and working out. I wish life could be like this all the time, :-).</p>

    <p>Today, was yet another day of complete relaxation. All I did was mainly work on a few side software projects that I have been messing around with. Beyond that, I of course took in the amazing environment surrounding me. I also did some exploration and research of Mac OS-X software. Specifically, I look at &#8220;Mac Ports&#8221;, &#8220;Fink&#8221;, &#8220;TextMate&#8221;, &#8220;Adium&#8221;, and &#8220;Quicksilver&#8221;. All of which look to be amazing pieces of software. The reason I was investigating Mac OS-X software is because I have a Mac Book Pro arriving shortly and I want to be able to get the system into a usable fashion as quickly as possible. Later after dark, I went to the pool and Jacuzzi and was told to get out of the Jacuzzi and pool because the pool closes after dark. Lame, out of the years that I have been here previously I have never seen the security people before. I have a feeling that the same person that called and complained on me for drinking a beer at the pool also called and complained about me being at the Jacuzzi after it was closed. People like that are so stupid, I just don&#8217;t get it. They really just need to get a life. Anyways, enough of my rantings for the day. Tomorrow I am going on yet another hike.</p>

<p>Today, I hiked the Hanalei &#8216;Okolehao Trail. It is a pretty aggressive trail relative to the grade. It gains 1,250 feet in approximately 2 miles. It is pretty relentless and the second half of the trail is becoming more and more over grown each day it seems. It is definitely a good hike to go on to get a good work out, :-). The trail starts out as a dirt road. After going about .75 miles you run into some power lines. This point provides a decent view of Hanalei Bay and the area around it.</p>

<p>After continuing on the relentless trail, it gradually gets more over grown. Once I made it to the top I noticed a number of off shoot trails. All of these trails went to tiny look out points which presented a view of probably about 1/5 of the island. A few of the views presented the Hanalei River in it&#8217;s vast entirety leading from it&#8217;s mouth in Hanalei Bay all the way up the canyon. Overall, the view is quite amazing. Beyond that though, the hike was worth it just for the amazing work out.</p>

<p>Once, the 4 miles of the hike were completed and I made it back to the condo I went for an afternoon dip in the pool and jacuzzi, and then ate lunch. After eating lunch and swimming some more I took a shower and got ready to go out to dinner at the Hanalei Dolphin. The Hanalei Dolphin is pretty pricey but most food is in Kauai. However, the Dolphin is generally about 30 bucks for a mediocre meal. Beyond that, the service was some of the worst service I have had. Maybe, it was the server, or maybe even just the night. But, either way I don&#8217;t think it is worth it for what you get. The one good thing I obtained out of tonights dinner was a free beer, :-). Got to love that!</p>

<p>Anyways, all in all it was another amazing day in paradise, :-).</p>

<dt>Well, it has been an amazing stay on Kauai, &#8220;the garden island&#8221;. Sadly now, it</dt>

<dt>is time to leave and go back to my normal (don&#8217;t know about that) every day</dt>

<dt>life, :-). It is some what refreshing to back to life as I know it, yet sad to</dt>

<dt>leave this unbelievably relaxing place. Oh, well. I will be back soon enough,</dt>

<dd>-). Until next time Kauai!</dd>
