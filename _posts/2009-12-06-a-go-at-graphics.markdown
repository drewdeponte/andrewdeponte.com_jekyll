Hi all. I recently tried my hand at a little graphic design work. A while back
I came up with the domain name lusciousbits.com and bought it. I had a couple
different ideas for that domain. However, I ran into a very difficult time
coming up with the concept for a logo for the site. After a while of
contemplating various concepts for logos and failing to come up with anything
useful, I started asking people what they thought of when they heard the word
luscious. It was astounding to me that the vast majority of people specifically
said "You know the Hot Chick Mud Flaps on Trucks?" So, I finally decided that
despite the fact that some may take it to be sexist I was going to use that and
attempt a little graphics work. I did not intend it to be sexist so please
don't take it that way. The tag line was lovingly donated by another Software
Engineer friend of mine (Patrick Murphy). Anyways, below is a wallpaper I
created based on this concept for lusciousbits.com. You can get the wallpaper
