Today on my vacation in Kauai I did two things. First I went on a hike up
Nounou Mountain (a.k.a. The Sleeping Giant) and second I moved from a condo I
was at on the east side of the island to the condo I normally stay at on the
north side of the island. First thing I did was wake up, pack the car, and
check out of my condo on the east side of the island. Then, I took a drive to
the base of the Nounou Mountain and started a hike up the east side of Nouou
Mountain. This trail has the greatest elevation change out of all the trails
and is about 2 miles in each direction. The east trail is mainly composed of a
{% medium_photo dsc_0172.jpg right %}
number of switch backs which traverse the mountain. The moist jungle trail
continues up to a vista point where a couple benches are setup under a shade
and a decent view is available. The vista point is NOT the top of Nounou
Mountain. There exists a trail that goes to the peak of Nounou Mountain which
is approx. 1,000 ft above the beginning of the trail. This trail is a bit more
difficult than the trail up to the benches, though not much. At the very top of
Nounou Mountain there is a block marking the peak. A decent view is available
once at the peak, however a much better view can be obtained if you take a
small trail from the peak to the front of the east plateau. After, enjoying the

view at the east plateau I followed the trail back a ways and peaked through
the hole in the giants chin. It is on a small trail that goes to the left of
the trail taken to get to the peak. After, deciding that the east plateau view
was better I continued my way back down the trail for the second 2 miles
completing a 4 mile hike.

After the amazing views from the Nounou Mountain hike I drove to the condo I
normally stay at on the north end of Kauai. I love the north end of Kauai so
much. It just seems like the more north you get the prettier and prettier it
gets. Hence the condo I normally stay at overlooks the northern coast of Kauai.
On the northern coast there aren't as many beaches due to the abundance of
cliffs. However, when you are in the mood to relax and take in something
unbelievably beautiful this is the place to be. After getting settled in to the
new condo I drank a beer while taking in the gorgeous ocean, and then went for
a dip in the pool and Jacuzzi. While sitting in the Jacuzzi drinking my brew a
security guard came up to me and told me there was no drinking allowed at the
pool and that someone called and complained that I was drinking a beer at the
{% medium_photo dsc_0197.jpg left %}
pool. First of all, LAME!, I have been coming to this same condo for years now,
all the time drinking beer, and I have never been told that before. In fact
they even used to give you drinks for free, pool side. Second of all, who the
hell is so bored and has such a pathetic depressing life that they have nothing
better to do but sit in their condo looking at the pool and call security when
someone is drinking a beer at the Jacuzzi and being totally quiet. However,
they did recently get bought out so maybe the rules have changed. Anyways, I
will verify the policy tomorrow and continue drinking my beers, :-D.

All in all, it was just another amazing day in "The Life of Drew", on Kauai, :-).
