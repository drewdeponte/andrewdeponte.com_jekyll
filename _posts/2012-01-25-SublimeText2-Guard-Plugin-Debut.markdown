Hi all. I know it has been a while. Please forgive me. My life has been a
little crazy. I am still in the process of buliding my house. I also recently
became engaged so I am trying to deal with wedding planning. Beyond that I am
still trying to get all my development work done for RealPractice, my side
company, and all of my open source projects.

Anyways, I needed a break from serious projects and decided it was time for a
small fun project that would potentially help me develop the more serious
projects more efficiently. A while back I started using a new text editor
called [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2). Basically it is what
TextMate 2 promised (and failed) to be and more.

So, since I have been using this for a while and I have been developing Ruby
and Rails apps lately using BDD and TDD I decided it was time to remove the
annoyance of having to switch to the terminal after each little development
iteration to check Guard's output to see why my tests are failing. Wow that was
a run on sentence. Oh, well it is 2 am and I just finished the plugin so bare
with me. Anyways. Therefore, I decided it was the perfect opportunity to build
a [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) plugin that integrates Guard
into it.

It is available with its documentation on GitHub at
[http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard](http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard).
Please don't hesitate to go grab it, use it, extend it, contribute back, report
bugs, or throw me new feature requests.
