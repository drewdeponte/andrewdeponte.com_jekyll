Today was a day of complete relaxation. I did absolutely nothing but relax in
the pool and Jacuzzi, eat, drink beer, and write software. It was a beautiful
day as usual here in paradise. I spent a few hours absorbing the rays and
hacking away on my latest projects while sipping on a Pacifico on the lanai. I
was very productive and got a lot of project clean up done. For the other half
of the day I absorbed more rays while doing laps in the pool and working out. I
wish life could be like this all the time, :-).
