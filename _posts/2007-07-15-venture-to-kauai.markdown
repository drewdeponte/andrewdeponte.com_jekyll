I woke up early today in L.A. and drove to L.A.X. to catch my flight to the
beautiful island of Kauai. After finally boarding the plane and taking off I
flew for about an hour, at which point the pilot came on the com system and
notified us that there was a problem with one of the window seals in the pilots
cabin. It was causing issues with being able to maintain cabin pressure so we
then had to turn around and fly back to L.A.X. After making it back to L.A.X.
the mechanics crew quickly, within 15 minutes, replaced the seal. Then, we
waited about another 45 minutes for the clearance paper work to be filed so we
could take off again and restart this venture to Kauai. Finally we took off
again and flew non-stop to Kauai only 3 hours late! I arrived at Lihue airport
and I couldn't have been happier. The humidity and temperature were just right.
I got a ride to where I was staying and relaxed the rest of the night after
eating. The adventure begins!
