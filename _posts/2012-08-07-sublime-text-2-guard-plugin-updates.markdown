I woke up early this morning and thought it was time for a little
[sublime_guard](http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard) love. I went through
and tackled all of the syntax highlighting issues. This included the following
issues ([#27](https://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/27),
[#30](https://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/30),
[#31](https://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/31),
[#38](https://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/38),
[#43](https://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/43),
[#29](https://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/29)).

I also cleaned up a number of tickets that were lying around and had either
been completed already or were tickets that were invalid.

I also started a branch for adding python3 support to the plugin. The branch is
named **python3_support**. I would love it if anyone out there in the ether
would grab that branch, test it out, and give me some feedback.

Anyways, I hope you guys enjoy the updates. As usual if you installed from
Package Control just restart Sublime Text 2. If you installed manually then
just pull the latest version down with Git.

See you all next time.
