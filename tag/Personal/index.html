    <p>Well, it has been a while since I posted any of my progress on the house. So here is a little update.</p>

<p>This weekend I finished laying all the tile in the bathroom shower, the bullnosed tiles for the baseboard and setting the shelf in the shower. If you want to see some pics of the state of it when I finished laying all the tile check out the link below.</p>

<p><a href='http://adoberevel.com/shares/aeb62c90ae424a1d8764bdabd73de954'>Bathroom Tiling Pictures</a></p>

<p>I also bought a wash tub for the garage. I did this so I can scrub my hands and my tools without having to come inside the house. Tonight I constructed the pipe system to connect from the wash tub to the existing drain system in the garage. If you would like to see how I tied the wash tub drain into the existing drain system you can check out the pictures below.</p>

<p>Anyways, my next steps for the bathroom are to clean all the tiles and make sure the grout paths are clear. Once, I have cleaned up the tile and grout paths I will be ready to grout the tiles. I will be using a polyblend sanded grout and a color matched caulk in the inner corners of the shower. I was told that I should use the caulk in the inner corners because the walls expand and shrink as the temperature changes and it usually causes grout in the inner corners to crack. Hence, use caulk because it is more flexible and can absorb the expansion and contraction of the walls.</p>

<p>I feel pretty good about all the progress I have made this weekend and can&#8217;t wait for the shelf to finish setting so that I can clean up all the tile and get to grouting. The vision of the bathroom is finally starting to come together and I can&#8217;t wait to get it finished.</p>

<p>Till next time.</p>

    <p>Well, I am back with some more updates on my <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard'>Sublime Text 2 Guard Plugin</a>. This is a smaller release than the last as I have been very busy. Despite its small stature it is an exciting one as we have another contribution to honor. The following are the recent updates:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed comma, single quote, question mark color issues (<a href='https://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/25'>#25</a>)</li>

<li>Fixed small color issue caused by <code>!</code> char (<a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/26'>#26</a>)</li>

<li>Better console colors, change <code>0 failures</code> from red to green (Thanks <a href='http://github.com/lidanh'>@lidanh</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>A special thanks goes out to <a href='http://github.com/lidanh'>@lidanh</a> for the code contribution. The new colors are much nicer and the <code>0 failures</code> being green instead of red makes it easier to detect success vs failure.</p>

<p>Thanks also goes out to all the users of the <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard'>Sublime Text 2 Guard Plugin</a>. Especially, the users that have been submitting bug reports and feature requests. This plugin wouldn&#8217;t exist without the direction and feedback from you all.</p>

<p>Please continue to provide feedback via Sublime Text 2 Guard Plugin <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues'>issues</a> on our GitHub page.</p>

    <p>Relatively recently I switched to ZSH for my shell. The primary reason I switched was that I had more flexibility in prompts as I can setup a right prompt and a left prompt. I also like the completion interfacing that ZSH provides. Anyways, I finally got around to generalizing my ZSH setup and makeing it available on GitHub as a backup for myself so that I can easily set it up again in the future, as well as a means of sharing my setup with all of you. Anyways, it is availabe on GitHub at <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/dotzsh'>http://github.com/cyphactor/dotzsh</a> with instructions on how to install it using git.</p>

    <p>Well, I got some more updates for you all.</p>

<p>My Sublime Text 2 Guard Plugin has recently been recognized as an essential Sublime Text 2 plugin on a nettuts+ blog post. Thanks to this publicity and the exposure via Package Control, Twitter, GitHub, and Google I have gotten some decent feedback, especially around my recent addition of colored output. Thanks to all that feedback I have pushed out the following improvements to the Sublime Text 2 Guard Plugin:</p>

<ul>
<li>Support for directory paths with spaces (<a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/pull/19'>#19</a>, Thanks <a href='http://github.com/ffmike'>@ffmike</a>)</li>

<li>Fixed dash based coloring issue (<a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/16'>#16</a>)</li>

<li>Fixed single quote based coloring issue (<a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/17'>#17</a>)</li>

<li>Fixed question mark based coloring issue (<a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/20'>#20</a>)</li>

<li>Fixed period based coloring issue (<a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/21'>#21</a>)</li>

<li>Fixed success dot section identification &amp; coloring issue (<a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/22'>#22</a>)</li>

<li>Fixed a second single quote based coloring issue (<a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/23'>#23</a>)</li>

<li>Added command relativity (<a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/24'>#24</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The above break down of improvements include primarily a bunch of coloring fixes, command relativity, and one very important issue that deserves some recognition, issue <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/pull/19'>#19</a> by <a href='http://github.com/ffmike'>@ffmike</a>. This is the Sublime Text 2 Guard Plugin&#8217;s first contribution. Much thanks goes out to <a href='http://github.com/ffmike'>@ffmike</a> for being our first contributor.</p>

<p>As usual if any of you have identified bugs or features that you would like added please submit them on the GitHub Issues page for the <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues?sort=created&amp;direction=desc&amp;state=open'>Sublime Text 2 Guard Plugin</a>.</p>

    <p>Hey all,</p>

<p>I know there are a number of you who have been eagerly awaiting this moment. I sure have been. I am proud to announce the first release of the <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard'>Sublime Text 2 Guard Plugin</a> that provides colored output. Basically, it ended up that I had to define a language file to identify the entities in the output and then define a theme to color those identified entities. Once, I did that I simply programatically set the color_scheme and syntax options for the output panel and like magic colors worked. Given the complexity of the language definition and the limited test cases I had when developing I am sure there are going to be some bugs to work out. So, as usual please create issues if you find any of these <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues'>issues</a>.</p>

    <p>Hey all,</p>

<p>I was having some difficulties with a couple bugs in the Sublime Text 2 Guard plugin I have been working on. So, I decided I would drop Jon Skinner, developer of Sublime Text 2, an e-mail and see if he knew about the issues I was having and hopefully of solutions/work arounds for them. Jon, was very helpful in terms of better understanding the issues as well as suggesting some work arounds.</p>

<p>Anyways, given the input from Jon I took another look at the bugs/features of the Guard plugin and decided to tackle them tonight. The following items show the progress that I made tonight with respect to the Sublime Text 2 Guard plugin:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enabled native Sublime Text 2 word wrap in the Guard output view.</li>

<li>Guard now exits properly when Sublime Text 2 exits/dies.</li>

<li>Added default key bindings to show Guard output view (super+shift+c)</li>

<li>Submitted a pull request to get the Guard plugin added to the <a href='http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control'>Package Control</a> repository list.</li>
</ul>

<p>As usual I am looking for feedback issues (feature requests, bug fixes, etc.) You can find the project as <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard'>sublime_guard</a> on GitHub. As of tonight I am down to two feature requests. So, please create bugs in the issues if you run into any so that I can work on fixing them sooner rather than later.</p>

    <p>Just dropping a quick note to all that follow my blog. Last night I made a numeber updates to the <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard'>Guard Plugin</a> for <a href='http://www.sublimetext.com/2'>Sublime Text 2</a>. Most of these were in direct response to feedback that I got from users after making the initial release on my blog, I think, two days ago. The modifications I made are enumarted below:</p>

<ul>
<li>The biggest addition is <code>RVM detection and integration</code>. The plugin is now intelligent enough to detect if you have RVM installed and detect if you are using a Project specific .rvmrc and of course respond by calling Guard appropriately depending on the case.</li>

<li>Another relatively small fix is a <code>vertical only auto-scroll</code>. Before, if Guard output went to the right past the width of the pane it was auto-scrolling to the right and then bouncing back to the left at the next line. Now, it always scrolls down the left most column of the output basically making it auto-scroll vertically.</li>

<li>Third I added some output preprocessing that <code>strips out the Terminal Color
Codes</code> so that the output is a bit cleaner.</li>

<li>I also added a lot of <code>descriptive output and error handling and output</code> to let the user better know what is failing so they might be able to debug the situation a bit better.</li>
</ul>

<p>As always if you have any feedback (feature requests, bug reports, etc.) you can simply create an issue for the project at the projects <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues'>GitHub Issues Page</a>.</p>

<p>If you are new to the <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard'>Guard Plugin</a> for <a href='http://www.sublimetext.com/2'>Sublime Text 2</a> you can find installation instructions and document on the <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard'>GitHub Page</a>.</p>

    <p>Hi all. I know it has been a while. Please forgive me. My life has been a little crazy. I am still in the process of buliding my house. I also recently became engaged so I am trying to deal with wedding planning. Beyond that I am still trying to get all my development work done for RealPractice, my side company, and all of my open source projects.</p>

<p>Anyways, I needed a break from serious projects and decided it was time for a small fun project that would potentially help me develop the more serious projects more efficiently. A while back I started using a new text editor called <a href='http://www.sublimetext.com/2'>Sublime Text 2</a>. Basically it is what TextMate 2 promised (and failed) to be and more.</p>

<p>So, since I have been using this for a while and I have been developing Ruby and Rails apps lately using BDD and TDD I decided it was time to remove the annoyance of having to switch to the terminal after each little development iteration to check Guard&#8217;s output to see why my tests are failing. Wow that was a run on sentence. Oh, well it is 2 am and I just finished the plugin so bare with me. Anyways. Therefore, I decided it was the perfect opportunity to build a <a href='http://www.sublimetext.com/2'>Sublime Text 2</a> plugin that integrates Guard into it.</p>

<p>It is available with its documentation on GitHub at <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard'>http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard</a>. Please don&#8217;t hesitate to go grab it, use it, extend it, contribute back, report bugs, or throw me new feature requests.</p>

    <p>I know its a been a while since I made my last update about the progress on my house. I have been super busy with the house and a few other projects I have going on, not to mention my full time Job, :-). However, this weekend I manage to get quite a bit done. Probably, the most significant thing was the fact that I dug up over 4 inches of dirt for the entire backyard and put new soil down with furtilizer and laid some fresh sod down. My backyard actually is starting to look like a backyard. It feels so much better.</p>

<p>Secondly, I ripped out a wall, reframed it, and framed in another White Lami Pocket Door in the front bedroom. Hence, the closet now has a White Lami Pocket Door and so does the bathroom that is connected to the front bedroom. Seeing, the two White Lami doors hanging side by side helps me realize that my vision for this room is finally coming together.</p>

<p>Beyond, those feets I have been spending some time looking at fixtures for the bathroom that is attached to the front bedroom because the next step is really putting the plumbing for the fixtures in. Once, that is done I can drywall and tile the bathroom and the bedroom and put the fixtures in. Anyways, its coming together and I was definitely happy with the progress I made this weekend.</p>

<p>If you are interested in a short video update from me on this weekend please check it out below.</p>

    <p>Hey all,</p>

<p>I know it has been a while since I posted an updated on the house and I finally felt like I had a moment to breath tonight so I am going for it.</p>

<p>I was lucky that this year my family was doing Christmas at my Sister and her husbands house because it meant that my parents came out a bit early and they wanted to help with my house. So on the one day they came over, my Mom (I think of her as a master of mud) started cutting drywall to patch all the holes in the living room that I had to create to fix the gas lines and replace the electrical. While my Mom was doing that my Dad and I repiped the kitchen and got it hooked up to the new copper water system I put in the attic a little bit ago. My new dishwasher was delivered right around 7:00 pm so we called it a night.</p>

<p>The next day my Dad came over for a couple hours and we redid some of the electrical in the kitchen so that my new dishwasher would have electricity. After, that we installed my new garbage disposal and then install the new dishwasher. Oh, and when we repiped the kitchen we also ran cold water to the fridge which didn&#8217;t used to exist before so now I have a fridge that has water and can do cool things like make ice!</p>

<p>Once we stopped working it was time to clean up and get ready to go see some family for Christmas eave which was nice. I learned about a very interesting iPhone/iPad game called Osmos. It is a very interesting game centralized around a gravity simulation. Then today I woke up and went over to my Sisters house and spend time with her and her husband, their kids, my parents, and my sisters husbands parents. It was a nice to spend time with them. I feel like I have been so busy lately that I haven&#8217;t had a chance to see anyone except for people at work.</p>

<p>Plus its always nice to get presents, :-). This year was amazing I got clothes that I needed. Beyond that I got some other very practical things that I can use such as worm drive circular saw and a rolling tool chest. Anyways, thats my update I think next thing to tackle on the house is to repipe the laundry in the garage with copper. Once, that is done then I can repipe the existing bathroom, the one I am currently using, over a weekend. Once, those two things are done I will no longer be dependent on any galvanized water pipes and I can get rid of all of them, including the old tanked water heater which is still hooked up to them.</p>

<p>So, I hope you all had as nice of a Christmas as I did. I will try to post soon with another update on the house.</p>

    <p>So for those of that don&#8217;t know, I lead of team of software developers. For a long time now I have noticed a number of gaps in the industry with respect to software development and team collaboration. One area that I always felt was missing some love was group chat.</p>

<p>Sure, there are a large number of different chat protocols and applications that implement them all. However, they generally miss an archived history that has full text searching. Beyond the group chat is prime location to distribute push notifications when Git repositories that the team is working with have changes pushed to them. Because of these two issues and number of other that I really don&#8217;t want to get into at this point I have started a new open source project called <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/archaic'>&#8220;Archaic&#8221;</a>.</p>

<p><a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/archaic'>Archaic</a> is a Rails application that provides archiving of IRC channel chats with a full text search interface as well as general developer helpers. It is composed of two pieces, an IRC Bot and the Rails application. Technically they both share the rails environment as the IRC Bot should be run with rails runner. You can checkout the project at the following: <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/archaic'>http://github.com/cyphactor/archaic</a>.</p>

<p>I plan to keep the master branch functional so feel free to use the master branch. It currently has the following features.</p>

<ul>
<li>IRC Chat Archiving</li>

<li>Full Text Chat Archive Searching with Context (to expand context simply click on resulting match)</li>

<li>Week number helper (when anyone in IRC channel types &#8220;weeknum&#8221; it replies with current week number)</li>

<li>Ticket number helper (when anyone in IRC channel types &#8220;#\d+&#8221; it replies with link to that ticket)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the initial introduction to this project and I am sure it has numerous directions that it can and will grow into. I very much welcome your thoughts, suggestions, feature requests, bug reports, testing, etc.</p>

<p>I believe that having a good central place of communication for a team even if they are working in the same office helps at least as a mechanism for keeping your devs notified about repo pushes close to real time.</p>

<p>Anyways, enjoy!</p>

    <p>So as some you already know I have been crazy busy with work as of late preparing for the launch of our new product. Hence, I haven&#8217;t had much time to work on the house. However, this weekend I finally had some time and decided it was time to break into the slab of the front shower so that I could replace the piping that connects to the drain and the piping that connects to the vent. The following video shows the results of this little adventure.</p>

    <p>I don&#8217;t know about your Mom, but my Mom always amazes me. Those of you who know me or follow my blogs know that about a year ago I bought a house and the backyard had two brick benches on the patio. The one thing they were missing was some nice bench covers. So, my Mom, being the amazing Mom that she is, decided she was going to make me some. So my Mom &amp; Aly went to the store and picked brought back samples of outdoor fabrics and I picked one.</p>

<p>A few weeks later my Mom called me and asked for the measurements of the benches and soon enough she brought me some amazing bench covers. Given that my parents live in Virginia when she came to visit she didn&#8217;t want to bring the foam for the covers with her so she had it shipped to me. Two days ago I got the foam and today I finally got around to finishing the cutting and installation of the foam. After, I finished I tried them out and they look amazing.</p>

<p>To check out some photos of them in their final state check them out <a href='http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.535708104810.2048945.30901409&amp;type=3&amp;l=1b5b6f0f43'>here</a>.</p>

    <p>Hey All, I know it has a been a while since I made a post on my progress with the house. But, that is because I have been crazy busy with me new job and have also been sick for a decent amount of that time. Anyways, my parents were visiting from Virginia this past weekend so my Dad came over to my house and helped me on Saturday and Sunday for bit with the copper repipe I recently started. Prior to my Dad getting here I ran all the copper for the cold water mainline in the attic up to the wall right before the new tankless water heater.</p>

<p>On Saturday and Sunday my Dad and I finished running the cold through that wall, connecting the cold to the tankless water heater, running the hot into the attic, and wiring the electrical for the tankless and connecting it. This leaves me with needing to finish running the hot mainline with the rest of the valves in the attic and then doing room drops as necessary for the new laundry room, kitchen, and bathroom. If you are interested in seeing you can checkout the clip below.</p>

    <p>So, as many of you may know I recently took a position heading up a new software engineering team that is responsible for producing the new products. One of my first actions when I came on board was switching my team over from SVN to Git. One of the engineers on the team abandoned a branch in one of our Git repositories because he didn&#8217;t think he would need it anymore. Soon, after he realized that he wanted something from that branch but now he couldn&#8217;t see the brach anymore in &#8216;gitk &#8211;all&#8217; or any of the other tools because he abandoned it. But, it has to still be there right, it is Git.</p>

<p>I knew there was a way to do this in Git and I have done it in the past but I couldn&#8217;t remember how. After I explained a bit more to him about the internals of Git and he went off and did some exploration he came back to me with his found solution which follows:</p>

<p><code>git fsck --unreachable| cut -f3 -d&#39; &#39;|xargs git rev-list --header|less</code></p>

<p>I know there is some other way to find abandoned nodes in Git but I still can&#8217;t remember. Anyways, just figured I would share this method in the hopes that it would help someone out there. It may not be exactly what you want with respect to the &#8216;cut&#8217; or &#8216;xargs&#8217; but I will let you all play with it a bit to get exactly what you want.</p>

    <p>Hey all. I know its been a while since my last post. But, life has been a little crazy. I recently took a position at a new company called <a href='http://realpractice.com'>RealPractice</a> heading up the software engineering team that is responsible for all of their new products. I am very excited to start up a new team and build some amazing software. I can&#8217;t wait to get started building a strong team that builds even stronger software.</p>

<p>I have a feeling that this will put a bit of a slow down into the progress on the house. But, this is what I love doing, so I think it is worth it. This may also for a temporary period of time also slow down my rate of posting with respect to software tid-bits. But, I will come back stronger than ever with more stuff to post about.</p>

    <p>After getting the 100 AMP Sub-Panel run last week as well as wiring two of the bedrooms and one bathroom I had one major bit left. Driving a ground rod and connecting it non-spliced to the cold water pipe and then to the main panel&#8217;s ground bus (or in my case neutral bus because it doesn&#8217;t have separate buses). I acquired the ground rod and some THHN 4 AWG to connect the ground rod to the main panel last weekend. So, today I woke up and since I decided that the best place to drive the ground rod was next to the gas meter I had to first dig out around the gas meter to find out where the gas main comes in. This was necessary so I didn&#8217;t accidentally drive the ground rod through it. So, once I dug for a while I finally found the gas main and followed it to make sure that where I wanted to put the ground rod wouldn&#8217;t effect the gas main. Luckily my original position was fine. So, then I started driving the 10ft copper clad rod into the ground with a sledge hammer such that a little less than a foot of the rod was exposed.</p>

<p>Once the rod was driven into the ground I then had to run the THHN 4 AWG from the rod to the cold water pipe and to the main panel. Getting the rod in the ground safely took me most of the day and was pretty damn exhausting. Running the THHN 4 AWG was a bit of a pain too just because I had to squeeze in by the eaves again. Anyways, I made a little update video clip showing what we did this week and last week with the electrical stuff. Check it out below.</p>

    <p>Well, I came back from my Kauai trip refreshed and ready to get some stuff done on the house. Today I worked with my Dad and Uncle to get the 100 AMP Sub-Panel run from the main panel with 2-3 Romex cable as well as rewire two of the bedrooms and one of the bathrooms. The 2-3 Romex is pretty expensive. I decided to get the 2-3 Romex rather than buying the individual conductors and conduit just because the price difference was relatively small and the 2-3 Romex is less work. Running the 2-3 was a bit of a pain given that the main panel is right were the eaves come down so I had to squeeze myself in real tight to get it run. But, I did it and now it is done. After a little exploration we also discovered that the main panel is only grounded to the cold water pipes in the attic which isn&#8217;t up to code. I am very happy with the progress we made and I will have to fix the grounding next weekend.</p>

    <p>Woot woot! Aly and I just got back from an awesome Flight of the Conchords Concert at the Hollywood Bowl. I was very impressed with how they sounded live. Their stage presence and performance in general is just amazing. When I think about them, I always group them conceptually with parity bands. However, I think the thing I love the most about them is their raw musical talent and abilities to playing a vast number of genres really well while still doing intelligent comedy. Anyways, I had a blast and I strongly recommend going to see them live if you get the chance.</p>

    <p>So, if you recall I few posts back I wrote about how I had run the new gas pipes for the new laundry room and the tankless water heater. I also pressure tested the system but found it was still dropping 1 to 2 10ths of a PSI in about 15 mins. This Saturday my goal was to go through and find the leaks in the branches one by one and fix them and retest.</p>

<p>I did exactly that, I pressurized the gas lines up to 100 PSI and soap tested and to my wonder none of the new piping I added had any leaks. So, I then started testing all the other branches. I found leaks in the Tanked Water Heater branch, Stove branch, Old Stove Branch, and the Furnace Branch. Hence, I took apart all of these branches and cleaned the joints and reconnected all of the piping and then re-pressurized the system to 100 PSI found no leaks in those branches. That took me about all day to get that much done. Then I did a 15 PSI test for 15 minutes as required to pass inspection and found that it was now dropping just 1 10th of a PSI in 15 mins. I was done for the day though and frustrated after spending the entire day fixing and testing leaks one by one.</p>

<p>Sunday I called my buddy Dave and had him come over at 9:00 am to help me accomplish my goal for Sunday which was to take all the gas piping out and put it all back in cleaning and fixing each of the joints. The reason this was my goal was because Saturday night when I was burnt out I did a 100 PSI soap test again and found a bunch of leaks up in the attic in the mainline. Luckily it ended up that whoever did the gas lines before wasn&#8217;t a complete idiot because they put a union right in the middle of the gas lines which allowed me to basically split the house in two halves and only have to redo one half on Sunday.</p>

<p>Dave and I redid the the kitchen half of the house on Sunday and soap tested and pressure tested it and all is good on that half of the house we are losing 0 PSI in all of pressure testing. That half covers the Tanked Water Heater, Stove, New Laundry Hookup, and Tankless Water Heater. Next weekend the plan is to finish the other half of the house which covers the Current Laundry, Fire Place, and Furnace.</p>

<p>Let the adventure continue, :-)</p>

    <p>Well, I got back early Monday morning from a little trip to Humboldt County, CA to see my friend Bethany graduate from Humboldt State University. If you didn&#8217;t know already, Humboldt State University is where I graduated from years ago. Anyways, it was very nice to take some time off from my busy life and just relax and enjoy the Humboldt environment. It is most definitely a place I will always love because of the calm and the nature that surrounds you.</p>

<p>While there I also had the pleasure of spending time with Bethany&#8217;s brother and parents. I have been friends with them since I can remember and it seems like as of late with the house and everything else I haven&#8217;t had much time to see them. Hence, it was very nice to visit with them. We drove up to Patrick&#8217;s Point on Sunday and walked around. If you aren&#8217;t familiar with Patrick&#8217;s Point it is a State Park and is a beautiful place to visit. Pictures of our visit to Patrick&#8217;s Point can be found <a href='http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.535700569910.2048934.30901409&amp;type=3&amp;l=d725d324ac'>here</a>.</p>

<p>Sadly, toward the end of this trip I caught a very nasty cold and have been sick since. Sometimes things just have to go that way. Oh well, soon enough I will be to my normal self and kicking ass and taking names, :-).</p>

    <p>Few, I just completed a very exhausting weekend with Aly and my parents. This weekend I ordered a dumpster because my parents were coming down to help work on my house and I had a massive pile of rubble in the backyard RV parking spot that needed to go. Once we loaded the dumpster with all of the rubble (more than two rooms of plaster) we decided to demo another room as the allocated 18 inches of heavy material at the bottom wasn&#8217;t filled. This was crucial in my opinion because that damn dumpster cost so much.</p>

<p>Once, we had completed the plaster portion of the dumpster loading my Dad and I went to finish running the new gas pipes to the tankless water heater and pressure test them while Aly and my Mom worked on the back yard patio. It took us all weekend to get the pipes in and pressure tested. There is still a small leak as it is dropping 2 10ths of a PSI in 15 mins. Hence, further pressure testing is needed to get to the required state of holding 15 PSI for 15 mins. We went through and tested all of the new joints numerous times but couldn&#8217;t find any leaks. Hence, we talked to some people we know in the industry and it seems that when you pressure test and find a leak you generally have to jack up the pressure pretty high 60 to 100 PSI and spray the entire joint not just the threading edges to find the leaks because some joints, elbows especially, tend to have pin holes due to imperfect manufacturing. We probably could have gotten this handled if it hadn&#8217;t been Mother&#8217;s Day on Sunday but it was nice to take a break and visit with family anyways.</p>

<p>Little did my Dad and I know, while we were hard at work on the black iron pipes, Aly and my Mom had done a huge amount of cleanup on in the backyard, started tilling the grass we previously killed, and removed most of the old nasty fiber glass patio cover. I was amazed with how much they managed to get done.</p>

<p>Thanks Girls!!</p>

<p>As usual I took pictures to let you all in on the progress. You can see them <a href='http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.535700310430.2048932.30901409&amp;type=3&amp;l=2a1476b7e5'>here</a>.</p>

<p>Oh, I also managed to replace the lighting boxes that were previously under the patio cover with outdoor boxes and light fixtures. Stay tuned for new developments with the house.</p>

  <section>
    <p>So I setup my MacBook Air right after I got it and was just using the basic functionality. I then realized that I needed root to do something. Yep, you guessed it, I some how managed to to fat finger my root password when I setup the initial Admin user in the setup process. This is normally not a big deal as you can always put the DVD back in and rerun the setup wizard to create a new user. However when you are a MacBook Air and have no DVD drive it gets to be a tad bit more complex.</p>

<p>The key is single user mode. After some googling I found that you can easily get into single user mode on Mac OS X simply by rebooting and right after the Chime noise holding Command-S and it will start you up into single user mode. For details on single user mode please go <a href='http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1492'>here</a>.</p>

<p>When you see the prompt for single user mode it will tell you two commands to run to make it so that you can modify the file system. One is a fsck command and the other is a mount command. I simply ran the two commands as the info above the prompt instructed me to. Once it was done running those commands, I ran the following command and rebooted so that it would start the initial setup process over again. I did this because I knew that if I created a new Admin user and knew its password I could then sudo in and change the password of my existing Admin user that I previously fat fingered the password for.</p>

<p><code>$ rm /var/db/.AppleSetupDone</code></p>

<p>I know that there are command line tools that allow you to change passwords, etc. in Mac OS X, but for some reason I wasn&#8217;t feeling like looking up the directions on how to use them. Hence, I just did it this way. Figured I would share my find on Single User Mode, :-). I am sure someone has already found it, but it is new to me.</p>

    <p>Well, today I woke up like any other day in my life. I start by pulling my 17in Mac Book Pro out of my laptop bag. However, today I was greeted with a bit of surprise as you can see from the following photo.</p>

<p><img alt='17in MacBook Pro Battery Expanded' src='http://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc7/76715_535700265520_6468582_n.jpg' /></p>

<p>It seems that my 17in MacBook Pro battery had decided that it was going to expand while it was out of my laptop. Thank God it was out of my laptop. Who knows what kind of damage it would have caused if it was in the laptop when this happened. Luckily this was a spare battery as I have 2 batteries for my 17in MacBook Pro. I swap them out fairly often so that I have a charged extra battery in my laptop bag and the other stays in the laptop. I guess I won&#8217;t be doing that for a while .</p>

<p>I am somewhat disappointed. I have had this laptop for a few years at least but it still works like a champ and I would have thought that the battery would have failed from a charge holding perspective before the battery just decided to expand. Anyways, very strange so I figured I would share my surprise from this morning with you all. The sad part is that my other battery, the one currently in my 17in MacBook Pro, has started to expand as well. The aluminum shielding is bowing which means I am going to have to spend $129.00 on a new battery for my laptop. Oh, well, such is life.</p>

<p>Apparently this was a known issue according to friends of mine at work and I just didn&#8217;t know about it till it happened to me, :-). My friends also informed me that Apple supposedly fixed this issue with all their new batteries so if I buy a new battery it shouldn&#8217;t happen with that new battery.</p>

<p>Lets hope that they are right.</p>

    <p>Today, I woke up and realized that yesterday we neglected to take the stump of the biggest of the three plants out of the planter. Therefore, I decided that I was going to remove the stump and all of its roots. After digging it and all of its roots out there was already a huge hole and a large portion of the planter had been dug up. During my Mom&#8217;s last visit she had mentioned that I should put a pond in the corner of the planter where this biggest bush previously resided.</p>

<p>So, after looking at the results of removing the bush Aly and I decided that we might as well just finish the job and dig a hole for the pond in the corner. Hence, I dug&#8230; and dug&#8230; and dug&#8230; for hours in the baking sun. Actually, it felt good to be doing some physical labor and the weather was pretty decent. Anyways, I dug it up and started the basics of the framing of the pond and its various tiers.</p>

<p>Check out the results of my effort <a href='http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.535700165720.2048930.30901409&amp;type=3&amp;l=f4316bf9ab'>here</a> in these wonderful photos taken by my love Aly.</p>

<p>P.S. - The finished part of the planter was all thanks to the hard work of my Mom during her last visit. Wench, I love you! Thanks for your help.</p>

    <p>Today, was a busy day as usual in the life of Drew. Aly and I woke up relatively early and decided that it was time to work on the backyard planter. It was in severe need of ripping out plants and weeding. So, Aly and I got our tools together and went to work cutting, chopping, digging, trimming, weeding, pruning, and jumping up and down in the natural waste garbage can, trying to get all of the stuff to fit.</p>

<p>It was quite involved as we removed the three largest bushes from the planter. These bushes had root systems like I have never seen before. Some of them went almost the entire length of the planter. Anyways, we did that till about 1:00 pm and then I started some more demo work behind the fridge for the gas pipes so that I could get a proper measurements before we went to Subway for lunch and then to, you guessed it, Home Depot.</p>

<p>Once we got to Home Depot we went and gathered all of the black iron pipe pieces we needed to get the gas piping done up to the laundry room. Beyond that we got some ground cover bark for the planter that we started working on. Once we got back Aly focused on picking the many river rocks out of the planter that the previous home owners put in there for some reason. While she was working on the planter I started working on notching out studs, drilling holes in studs and other framing so that I could run the pipe through the wall cavity in as few pieces as possible. As always the more connections you have the more possibility there is for leakage. Hence, I always try to get pipes done in the fewest number of joints.</p>

<p>It took us roughly till about 8:00 pm tonight to get the gas piping done up to the laundry room and get the planter decently cleaned out. You can see pictures of the results of our hard work <a href='http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.535700065920.2048929.30901409&amp;type=3&amp;l=240a1dad70'>here</a>.</p>

    <p>Today was the 3rd and final day of installation for this batch of windows which in total included 8 windows, one 4 pane 10 foot sliding glass door, framing a door way in, and doing all the stucco work. When C &amp; M Windows got here the day began with a bunch of prep work for doing detail work and stucco.</p>

<p>Once they performed all the prep work they did the finish work on the inside of the sliding glass doors. This consisted of ripping some small pieces of wood to account for the thickness of the plaster because the Milgard Sliders are sizes the standard width of a 2x4 and therefore require that you put filler in the gap to finish it. Once they cut &amp; installed all the pieces using a micro nailer they starting with the molding. By the way micro nailers are bitchin. I am going to have to acquire one at some point soon, :-). It was interesting to see them measure and cut the molding because they didn&#8217;t measure it. They simply placed the first piece and marked it according to the door frame. They then cut that piece and one end of the top piece, placed it, dry fitted it, and then marked it on the right side. They then proceeded to cut that piece and proceeded with the same process with the right piece. This technique produced a much better result than jobs I have seen done in the past where they simply measured.</p>

<p>Anyways once they finished installing the molding they caulked it and then moved on to anchoring the framed in door to the concrete and then began the stucco process. During my lunch break today they were kind enough to give me a quick course in stuccoing. It is very similar in technique and process to that of mudding which I have as of recent become pretty damn comfortable with. Anyways, they ended up doing the single coat of scratch &amp; brown coat combo to bring the stucco out pretty much even around the door. They mixed in roughly 1/3 rd Mortar Mix with the Quickreet scratch &amp; brown coat combo mix to increase the setting time to roughly 20 mins.</p>

<p>After finishing that they went and did the scratch coat on the area where they framed in the door. The scratch coat was the same mixture but they did it as a slightly thinner batch (more water) so that it would mix in with the lath better. Once that started to set a tiny bit they scratched it and went back to the door and cleaned up the stucco as it is much easier to clean up if you let it set a little bit because it won&#8217;t pull the stucco out when you edge it off. Anyways, they then went back and loaded and floated the brown coat on the framed in door and feathered it to blend it with the existing stucco. Once it was all even they let that set for a bit and started mixing the color coat which they had a chart that let them know what color coats to mix to produce the closest color stucco. Then they mixed that which was a much thinner batch compared to the scratch and brown. Beyond that, they did NOT mix in the mortar mix this time. They simply used the straight up color coat with some water as usual.</p>

<p>Anyways, they finished the color coats and cleaned up the stucco here and there after they let it set a bit and then did finishing touches on cleaning up the doors and removing the tap and cover from the slider as well as just doing general cleanup. And that was it, my doors were installed I wrote the check for the final payment and like magic I have amazing new windows and a slider and got a lesson in stucco.</p>

    <p>Today was yet another exciting day. C &amp; M Windows came back for the second day of my new windows installation. The plan for today was for them to get my new 10 foot 4 pane sliding door framed in and installed with the necessary weather proofing minus the stucco and finish work on the inside. The other object that they set out to complete today was framing in the side door to the area which is now going to become an indoor laundry room so that I don&#8217;t have go out to the garage to do laundry.</p>

<p>C &amp; M Windows managed to accomplish both of these tasks today within reasonable amount of time and were a pleasure to have around the house as usual. Last night when I was attempting to fall asleep it was amazing to notice the difference in the amount of sound now that all the new dual pane windows have been installed vs. the old single pane windows. Tonight, thus far has been even quieter as the sliding door has been installed. Beyond that the temperature difference between the house and the outside is much better now.</p>

<p>They worked on the slider framing and installation first and then proceeded to frame in the door and prep it with necessary moisture barriers and lath so that tomorrow they could mix the stucco and do the all the stucco in one session and finish work in one session. I can&#8217;t wait for tomorrow to come and to see the results of all this work and money.</p>

<p>If you are interested in seeing the results of today click <a href='http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.535699781490.2048927.30901409&amp;type=3&amp;l=19a3bc4d10'>here</a>. I included pictures of both new slider and the side door where you can see the flashing, moisture barrier, and the lath that will receive the scratch, brown, and color coat of stucco tomorrow.</p>

    <p>Well, tonight was another good night in the life of Drew. A combination of luck and changing up my poker game won me a total of $220.00 after a $40.00 buy in. It started off with a 12 player game which is a pretty packed game. Each player bought it with a $20.00 and had the option of buying in a second time for another $20.00. Luckily I chose to buy in again because the hands kept coming my way after a little patients. Thats generally what poker is about in my opinion. Being patient enough to wait till the time is right to make your moves. Anyways, I very much enjoyed the game and night. I hope everyone else did as well. Maybe you all will get lucky next time.</p>

    <p>Hey all, I figured I would write this blog because as of late a number of people have asked me how I have gone about finding jobs. So, I figured I would write a blog post on this topic and explain my perspective, the various entities involved, and the process that I generally use for finding a job.</p>

<p>First let me begin by saying I truly believe that the first thing you have to do is mentally prepare yourself for the experience. You might be thinking &#8220;What the hell does that mean?&#8221; Well, simply it means that you need to set your expectations of results in a realistic fashion. This means taking into consideration the economy, your work experience in the industry you are attempting to enter and coming to the realization that the number of resumes you have to put out for you to get a valid hit back is a very very large number. I will explain why further down in this post. The point is don&#8217;t be disappointed if you feel like you aren&#8217;t getting enough response and just keep plugging away.</p>

<p>Once you have mentally prepared yourself the second thing you have to do is understand the system. Long ago I came to the realization that just about everything in life can be thought of as a system. There are various components that build up that system and they all work in very specific manners to produce the system. In this case the system is composed of the following components:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Potential Employee&#8217;s</em> - Anyone that is looking for employment. Keep in mind these are not just unemployed people but also employed people that are looking to potentially move up in their career or simply make a lateral move to get out of a position they aren&#8217;t happy in.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>Potential Employers</em> - Companies that are in the market for talent (Potential Employee&#8217;s). In the IT and Software environments (my area of expertise) there are a number of different types of employment that various employers are looking for. You need to keep your eye out for them so that you can find the type of job that you like. Below I provide a brief list of the most common and give my thoughts on each.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Contract Positions</em> - These are positions that are usually set to a fixed duration often 3 - 6 months. Sometimes they go for a couple years. The negative thing about contract positions from an employee perspective is that you aren&#8217;t really an employee. You are treated as an independent contract in most cases. Hence, you have to pay taxes as an independent contractor, meaning you pay all the taxes and the company doesn&#8217;t pay any taxes for you. In California this means you have to pay estimated taxes every few months if I remember correctly (consult a tax professional for details). Since you are paying taxes as an independent contractor you also need to manage your money in a much tighter fashion as the company is not paying any taxes to the government for you out of each paycheck. Instead you get all the money and you are the one responsible for setting aside money to pay your own taxes every required estimated tax iteration (consult a tax professional). Anyways, this is an awesome deal for the company in that they don&#8217;t pay any taxes on you and you may think it is a good deal because you are making more than you normally would but you are generally wrong because the taxes are different when you are an independent contractor (please consult a tax professional for further details). Also think about the fact that there are no health benefits, dental, etc so you will have to pay for that all out of pocket.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>Contract To Hire Positions</em> - These positions are similar to the straight up contract positions except they are at least positioned such that the company is saying they want to contract you for a short period of time and then if they like you then they will hire you. I have had friends who join as a contractor in a contract to hire position and the company simply keep renewing the contract. This is to the companies benefit because they don&#8217;t pay taxes on you as employee. However, that is not how the company represented themselves to you when they were looking for you as an employee in the first place. Hence, they should pull you in as a full-time employee. So, be careful. I know it is hard to judge companies but do your best and if you end up in a situation like this, don&#8217;t let them walk all over you.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>Full Time Positions</em> - These are positions where the company is looking to actually make you a full-time employee right off the bat. These positions often come with health benefits, dental coverage, etc (not guaranteed in todays economy but something to shoot for). In these positions you are treated as an employee of the company and therefore the company pays taxes on you as an employee. Beyond that you have a W-4 which is used to identify how much should come out of your paycheck and be paid to the government out of each paycheck towards your taxes (consult a tax professional on identifying what this should be).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>Head Hunters</em> - Head Hunters are basically people that Potential Employees can hire to help find them Potential Employers. These are somewhat rare now days as it seems to have gone toward the Recruiter side of things which you can read about in the next bullet. The key thing to know is that the <em>Potential Employee</em> is the one who pays the <em>Head Hunters</em>. Hence, this is generally not a route you want to go as a Potential Employee.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>Recruiters</em> - Recruiters are companies that are hired by the Potential Employers to find good talent. Generally, these recruiters don&#8217;t know shit about the technologies other than the buzz words. That fact should tell you something. What you may ask does it tell you. Well, it tells you that it is all a numbers game. This is something you should very much remember. IT IS A NUMBERS GAME. If you are confused by what I mean you can read about it below. The key things to note here is that the <em>Potential Employers</em> are the ones who pay the <em>Recruiters</em>, and that this is all a numbers game (at first at least).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, that you have an idea of what all the components in the system are and what their rolls are it is time to discuss my process. The process consists of the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Searching</em> - The first step in the process is what I refer to as the searching step. This is something that I did initially and then used a very powerful tool called RSS/Atom Feeds to my advantage in combination with a feed reader. On Mac OS X (my platform of choice) I used a free application called <a href='http://www.newsfirerss.com/'>News Fire</a>. <a href='http://www.newsfirerss.com/'>News Fire</a> is simply an RSS/Atom Feed reader application. If you are on Windows don&#8217;t fret, just do some googling and you are sure to find a free RSS/Atom Feed reader. In fact google even provides a free RSS/Atom Feed reader service called google reader. The general idea here is that you can go to all the different job search sites Dice.com, CraigsList, Yahoo! HotJobs, Monster Jobs, Lycos Classifieds, Jobspring, jobs.joelonsoftware.com, Jobs.net, etc. At each of these sites you can specify your search criteria (location in which you are looking and keywords for position title). Once, you have provided the search criteria you can find the RSS/Atom feed link on the page to get your customized RSS/Atom Feed. Once, you have the link you can add it as an entry into your RSS/Atom Feed reader. After obtaining a large number of links of customized searches on the various job search sites and have populated your RSS/Atom Feed reader you are ready to move onto the next step in the process.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>Distribution</em> - The Distribution step is where my very important phrase IT&#8217;S ALL A NUMBERS GAME comes into play. The entire goal of this step is simply to distribute your resume and cover letter to as many job postings as possible while still keeping your sanity. My recommendation is to spend somewhere in between 1 - 3 hours a day going through the job postings that appear in your RSS/Atom Feed Reader and submit your resume to the ones that fit you. Once you reach the end of the 3rd hour you should simply mark all entries as read and move onto doing something you find productive. It is very important that you limit this effort to a maximum of 3 hours a day and mark them all read at the end so you have a fresh start tomorrow. The reason say IT&#8217;S ALL A NUMBERS GAME is because you need to saturate these job posting sites as much as possible with your resume for posting that fit you. The reason being that more than 50% of the job postings listed aren&#8217;t valid job postings. Instead they are generic postings made by <em>Recruiters</em>. This doesn&#8217;t change anything though, and in fact it helps you because <em>Recruiters</em> spend their day trying to match resumes up with actual job posting lists that they maintain. You continue this process day in and day out for as long as necessary until you find the job that you like and you finish with the hiring process. The primary objective of doing this is to get your resume and cover letter out to all these job postings, some of which are real, some of which are recruiters. Either way the goal is to get a phone interview or an in person Recruiter Interview which I will discuss next.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>Recruiter Interviews</em> - Recruiter Interviews are simply when a recruiting firm thinks you have potential to fill a position that they manage either now or in the future. This doesn&#8217;t make you special so don&#8217;t think it does. The key to remember when dealing with recruiters either on the phone or during recruiter interviews is that they are looking for very outgoing and ambitious people that are excited to be in the industry that they are trying to get into and willing to learn. The reason being that people of this nature are much easier for them to sell to the companies that are looking to hire good talent. I can&#8217;t recommend strongly enough that you take every interview you can because the more you do, the more comfortable you get during them. I suggest this even if they are simply recruiter interviews because the more recruiters you have looking for jobs for you the better off you are.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>Employer Phone Interviews</em> - Generally after you go through, either enough recruiter interviews or get lucky enough that one of your submitted resumes hits an actual company you get a phone interview. Depending on the company and how much they like you and your knowledge base, you may go through 1 to 5 phone interviews. The goal of the Potential Employer&#8217;s during these interviews is to get a better idea if you are one of a small number of Potential Employees that they will then have come in for one or more In Person Interviews. The key to remember with respect to Employer Phone Interviews is to relax, stay confident, and don&#8217;t pretend to know shit you don&#8217;t, oh and stay positive and ambitious. Companies, want people working for them that can grow. So, if they ask you a question that you don&#8217;t know the answer to ask them intelligent questions about it showing them that you are interested in learning and that you can critically think.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>Employer In Person Interview</em> - Eventually after doing enough phone interviews with employers you will hit a point where one employer will want you to come in for an In Person Interview. The employer&#8217;s job during these is to test you and see if you are really a good fit for the position. In the software and IT industry this usually consists of them talking to you for some number of hours about various technologies and quizing you either verbally with a white board or via written test. Often times if they have a number of candidates for the position they may ask you to come in a for a few different In Person Interviews to try and spend more time with you to assess your personality and how you would fit with the existing team, etc. The key to remember when doing this is to be interested, ambitious, willing to learn, and honest.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><em>You Win! (a.k.a. Got a Job)</em> - Eventually after going through the above steps a large number of you times you will get an offer for a position at one of the companies. Please read all the paper work and contracts you have to sign for any position you decide to go forward with. I will not go into negotiations and reading company positions at this point as it is an entire other article.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Anyways, the beauty of this process is that the RSS/Atom Feed Reader does the hard work for you and you only have to setup it up once and reconfigure it when you are decide you are looking for a new job title or in a new area. Also, keep in mind that it is time consuming process and you do have to focus and commit to following this process in order to accomplish your end goal of getting a job.</p>

    <p>As some of you may know from previous posts. I recently bought my first house which is very much a fixer upper. Anyways, today Aly and I just completed the first day of demo and here is a small walk through with Aly&#8217;s new HD Flip.</p>

    <p>Few, the stress and hesitation is over with. Today, I closed on my first house. I am now a home owner. Can you believe that? I can&#8217;t. It hasn&#8217;t really settled in yet that I now own my own home. Now, the excitement and overwhelming feeling comes of the massive project that is a fixer upper house. However, with that also comes the great satisfaction and feeling of accomplishment after I make every addition step towards my goals for this house.</p>

<p>Everyone keeps telling me that the tasks around the house will never end. I am sure they are right, but that is also part of what I love about it. It continually evolves as technology and time progress just as any good software does. Beyond that, I now get to make sure that it is the way I want it. In fact the two primary factors I took into consideration while looking for houses were Location, Location, Location, Location and a good base (framing, foundation) to start from. Oh, and I of course had to consider the money part as well. Luckily I found a repo that needed a lot of work but had an awesome location and fell just within my budget.</p>

<p>Buying this house was a very difficult decision to make as I am currently involved in a number of side software projects besides my normal full time job. However, everything seemed to fall into place and it felt like the right time. So, after weeks and weeks of contemplation and discussion with friends and family I finally decided to take the leap, and here I am now a home owner. Oh the life!</p>

    <a href='/images/photos/original/dsc_0345.jpg' target='_blank'><img align='left' src='/images/photos/medium/dsc_0345.jpg' /></a>
<p>Today, I hiked the Hanalei &#8216;Okolehao Trail. It is a pretty aggressive trail relative to the grade. It gains 1,250 feet in approximately 2 miles. It is pretty relentless and the second half of the trail is becoming more and more over grown each day it seems. It is definitely a good hike to go on to get a good work out, :-). The trail starts out as a dirt road. After going about .75 miles you run into some power lines. This point provides a decent view of Hanalei Bay and the area around it.</p>
<br /><a href='/images/photos/original/dsc_0363.jpg' target='_blank'><img align='right' src='/images/photos/medium/dsc_0363.jpg' /></a>
<p>After continuing on the relentless trail, it gradually gets more over grown. Once I made it to the top I noticed a number of off shoot trails. All of these trails went to tiny look out points which presented a view of probably about 1/5 of the island. A few of the views presented the Hanalei River in it&#8217;s vast entirety leading from it&#8217;s mouth in Hanalei Bay all the way up the canyon. Overall, the view is quite amazing. Beyond that though, the hike was worth it just for the amazing work out.</p>
<a href='/images/photos/original/dsc_0349.jpg' target='_blank'><img align='left' src='/images/photos/medium/dsc_0349.jpg' /></a>
<p>Once, the 4 miles of the hike were completed and I made it back to the condo I went for an afternoon dip in the pool and jacuzzi, and then ate lunch. After eating lunch and swimming some more I took a shower and got ready to go out to dinner at the Hanalei Dolphin. The Hanalei Dolphin is pretty pricey but most food is in Kauai. However, the Dolphin is generally about 30 bucks for a mediocre meal. Beyond that, the service was some of the worst service I have had. Maybe, it was the server, or maybe even just the night. But, either way I don&#8217;t think it is worth it for what you get. The one good thing I obtained out of tonights dinner was a free beer, :-). Got to love that!</p>

<p>Anyways, all in all it was another amazing day in paradise, :-).</p>

    <p>Today, was yet another day of complete relaxation. All I did was mainly work on a few side software projects that I have been messing around with. Beyond that, I of course took in the amazing environment surrounding me. I also did some exploration and research of Mac OS-X software. Specifically, I look at &#8220;Mac Ports&#8221;, &#8220;Fink&#8221;, &#8220;TextMate&#8221;, &#8220;Adium&#8221;, and &#8220;Quicksilver&#8221;. All of which look to be amazing pieces of software. The reason I was investigating Mac OS-X software is because I have a Mac Book Pro arriving shortly and I want to be able to get the system into a usable fashion as quickly as possible. Later after dark, I went to the pool and Jacuzzi and was told to get out of the Jacuzzi and pool because the pool closes after dark. Lame, out of the years that I have been here previously I have never seen the security people before. I have a feeling that the same person that called and complained on me for drinking a beer at the pool also called and complained about me being at the Jacuzzi after it was closed. People like that are so stupid, I just don&#8217;t get it. They really just need to get a life. Anyways, enough of my rantings for the day. Tomorrow I am going on yet another hike.</p>

<p>Today was a day of complete relaxation. I did absolutely nothing but relax in the pool and Jacuzzi, eat, drink beer, and write software. It was a beautiful day as usual here in paradise. I spent a few hours absorbing the rays and hacking away on my latest projects while sipping on a Pacifico on the lanai. I was very productive and got a lot of project clean up done. For the other half of the day I absorbed more rays while doing laps in the pool and working out. I wish life could be like this all the time, :-).</p>

    <a href='/images/photos/original/dsc_0211.jpg' target='_blank'><img align='left' src='/images/photos/medium/dsc_0211.jpg' /></a>
<p>Today, I slept through what looks to be an amazing sun rise based on the photo the people I am staying with took. That, is ok though, I am glad that I got the extra bit of sleep. After getting up and eating an amazing high fiber cereal for breakfast I took a 3/4 mile hike from the condo down to a place known as Queens Bath. Queens Bath, is supposedly a place where back in the day, the Queen used to come and bath due to the presence of an ocean fed pool.</p>
<a href='/images/photos/original/dsc_0250.jpg' target='_blank'><img align='right' src='/images/photos/medium/dsc_0250.jpg' /></a>
<p>I soon made it to the trail head and continued down a small muddy trail which follows a small creek that dumps into the ocean via a very cool looking water fall. After, making it all the way down the trail it opens up to plateau of lava rock. Following the lava rock to the left takes you to the well known Queens Bath which was very populated by the time I got there. Given that I am all about seclusion I continued hiking past the Queens Bath in hopes that I may find my own personal Kings Bath, :-).</p>
<a href='/images/photos/original/dsc_0238.jpg' target='_blank'><img align='left' src='/images/photos/medium/dsc_0238.jpg' /></a>
<p>After hiking a little ways past the Queens Bath, I saw in the distance another bath that was a bit smaller than Queens Bath. However, it was the perfect size for me and it was totally secluded from all the people enjoying Queens Bath. After, making it over to my &#8220;Kings Bath&#8221; I decided I had to get in. It is slightly tricky to get in to &#8220;Kings Bath&#8221; due to the abundance of sea urchins surrounding the edges of the bath. However, once you are in the bath it is an amazingly refreshing experience in crystal clear ocean water.</p>
<a href='/images/photos/original/dsc_0245.jpg' target='_blank'><img align='right' src='/images/photos/medium/dsc_0245.jpg' /></a>
<p>After enjoying my own private bath, I carefully climbed out of the bath making sure not to disturb the sea urchins and started my hike back to the trail. Once I made it back to the base of the trail I continued hiking to the right side of the trail which people have told me is usually surrounded by sea turtles. Despite the reports of the sea turtles I was not lucky enough to see any. It may have been due to the time that I was hiking at Queens Bath. Despite the fact that I did not see any sea turtles I did enjoy quite an amazing ocean view. After, taking in the view I hiked another 3/4 of a mile back to the condo and took a relaxing dip in the pool. I plan to spend the rest of the day relaxing and enjoying the pool and Jacuzzi at the condo.</p>

<p>Today was yet another relaxation day. However, instead of spending it on the east coast of Kauai like last time, I spent it at my normal condo on the north coast of Kauai. It rained all of last night and today with some very strong winds. Hence, I spent most of day inside relaxing, designing and writing software, watching movies and TV, playing card games, etc. I did however at one point during a small break in the weather catch a glimpse of the first rainbow I have ever seen exist on the water rather than in the sky. Beyond that, I did find out about the policy on the drinking at the pool and Jacuzzi. Basically, there is no rule that states one can&#8217;t drink at the pool. However, it is required that drinks be kept in plastic cups as to protect against excessive effort required to clean up broken glass in the Jacuzzi or pool. This rule totally makes sense and is beyond acceptable in my opinion. So, in short, I can continue drinking my beers at the pool or Jacuzzi. Thank God! I was really worried for a second there, hehe, :-). Overall today was very nice and quite relaxing.</p>

    <a href='/images/photos/original/dsc_0168.jpg' target='_blank'><img align='left' src='/images/photos/medium/dsc_0168.jpg' /></a>
<p>Today on my vacation in Kauai I did two things. First I went on a hike up Nounou Mountain (a.k.a. The Sleeping Giant) and second I moved from a condo I was at on the east side of the island to the condo I normally stay at on the north side of the island. First thing I did was wake up, pack the car, and check out of my condo on the east side of the island. Then, I took a drive to the base of the Nounou Mountain and started a hike up the east side of Nouou Mountain. This trail has the greatest elevation change out of all the trails and is about 2 miles in each direction. The east trail is mainly composed of a <a href='/images/photos/original/dsc_0172.jpg' target='_blank'><img align='right' src='/images/photos/medium/dsc_0172.jpg' /></a> number of switch backs which traverse the mountain. The moist jungle trail continues up to a vista point where a couple benches are setup under a shade and a decent view is available. The vista point is NOT the top of Nounou Mountain. There exists a trail that goes to the peak of Nounou Mountain which is approx. 1,000 ft above the beginning of the trail. This trail is a bit more difficult than the trail up to the benches, though not much. At the very top of Nounou Mountain there is a block marking the peak. A decent view is available once at the peak, however a much better view can be obtained if you take a small trail from the peak to the front of the east plateau. After, enjoying the <a href='/images/photos/original/dsc_0174.jpg' target='_blank'><img align='left' src='/images/photos/medium/dsc_0174.jpg' /></a> view at the east plateau I followed the trail back a ways and peaked through the hole in the giants chin. It is on a small trail that goes to the left of the trail taken to get to the peak. After, deciding that the east plateau view was better I continued my way back down the trail for the second 2 miles completing a 4 mile hike.</p>
<a href='/images/photos/original/dsc_0193.jpg' target='_blank'><img align='right' src='/images/photos/medium/dsc_0193.jpg' /></a>
<p>After the amazing views from the Nounou Mountain hike I drove to the condo I normally stay at on the north end of Kauai. I love the north end of Kauai so much. It just seems like the more north you get the prettier and prettier it gets. Hence the condo I normally stay at overlooks the northern coast of Kauai. On the northern coast there aren&#8217;t as many beaches due to the abundance of cliffs. However, when you are in the mood to relax and take in something unbelievably beautiful this is the place to be. After getting settled in to the new condo I drank a beer while taking in the gorgeous ocean, and then went for a dip in the pool and Jacuzzi. While sitting in the Jacuzzi drinking my brew a security guard came up to me and told me there was no drinking allowed at the pool and that someone called and complained that I was drinking a beer at the <a href='/images/photos/original/dsc_0197.jpg' target='_blank'><img align='left' src='/images/photos/medium/dsc_0197.jpg' /></a> pool. First of all, LAME!, I have been coming to this same condo for years now, all the time drinking beer, and I have never been told that before. In fact they even used to give you drinks for free, pool side. Second of all, who the hell is so bored and has such a pathetic depressing life that they have nothing better to do but sit in their condo looking at the pool and call security when someone is drinking a beer at the Jacuzzi and being totally quiet. However, they did recently get bought out so maybe the rules have changed. Anyways, I will verify the policy tomorrow and continue drinking my beers, :-D.</p>

<p>All in all, it was just another amazing day in &#8220;The Life of Drew&#8221;, on Kauai, :-).</p>

<p>I deemed today, yet another day of relaxation. I spent most of the day once again absorbing the peaceful atmosphere generated by the crashing of the waves on Nukoli&#8217;i Beach. After, spending a few hours on Nukoli&#8217;i Beach I went back to the condo and worked out for about an hour. I can&#8217;t let myself get completely out of shape because I am on vacation, come on! I then went and took a dip in the pool and soaked in the Jacuzzi. After my dip and soak I came back to the condo for some lunch and then ventured back out to Nukoli&#8217;i Beach to enjoy the evening air take a casual stroll down the beach. On my walk I saw hundreds and hundreds of sand crabs ducking and diving in and out of their little holes. After, my lovely walk on the beach I went back to the condo and ate dinner and relaxed some more, :-).</p>

    <a href='/images/photos/original/dsc_0119.jpg' target='_blank'><img align='left' src='/images/photos/medium/dsc_0119.jpg' /></a>
<p>As many of you may know. I am currently on the amazing island of Kauai enjoying what has been a quite an amazing and relaxing break from life. Today, I went on a hike to a set of water falls known locally as the Ho&#8217;opi&#8217;i Falls which consists of both an upper and lower falls powered by a decently large fresh water stream. The Ho&#8217;opi&#8217;i Falls are one of the most aggressive set of falls I have seen on Kauai when it comes to thrashing and rate of flow of the water. I started the hike by first finding the old dirt utility road which is a buried pretty deep inside a local neighborhood. After finding the road I hiked about a 1 mile or so back into what is an amazingly beautiful jungle to find the first falls, the upper falls. The upper falls was roughly a 20 ft fall which narrowed all the water causing a powerful flow. So, powerful that if a foot was placed in the water one would be easily swept away. The force and power of the water was quite humbling.</p>
<a href='/images/photos/original/dsc_0125.jpg' target='_blank'><img align='right' src='/images/photos/medium/dsc_0125.jpg' /></a>
<p>After taking in the extraordinary upper fall, I continued my hike further into the jungle for about 1 and 1/2 miles. The further and further I got into the jungle the denser the jungle got and the higher the humidity got. Given the location and the standing pools of water in between the falls, some friends of ours know as the mosquitoes joined me for the hike. I had heard that this hike was known to have mosquitoes so I sprayed Off all over before the hike. However, it did not seem to do any good. Despite the attacking mosquitoes I pushed forward through the jungle eventually finding the lower falls which was even more magnificent than the upper falls. The lower falls was easily a 100 ft drop and opened up allowing the falling water to cascade against a barrage of rocks below.</p>

<p>After spending some time hiking deeper into the jungle to see what I could find, I ran into a dead end where the faint animal trail I was following disappeared and the jungle got very dense. At this point I was frustrated with all the mosquito bites I had received and decided it was time to turn around and hike the approx. 2 1/2 miles back to the car. Despite the mosquitoes the hike was well worth it and provided me with a view of two of the most amazing water falls I have seen on Kauai.</p>

<p>After the hike yesterday I decided that today should be a day for relaxation. Hence, I took the day off from hiking and went and relaxed at the beach right next to the resort I am staying at. The beach is known as Nukoli&#8217;i Beach. This is an amazingly beautiful beach. The break has a short drop off which is pretty densely covered with rocks which helps reduce the number of annoying people on the beach. The beauty of this beach was amazing as I sipped my Pacifico resting on the beach from my previous days hike, :-).</p>
<a href='/images/photos/original/dsc_0091.jpg' target='_blank'><img align='right' src='/images/photos/medium/dsc_0091.jpg' /></a>
<p>I spent the rest of the day enjoying the weather, the beach, and of course the Pacifico, :-). After, spending my time at Nukoli&#8217;i Beach I went back to the resort and relaxed for a while in the pool and Jacuzzi. While in the pool and Jacuzzi, guess what I was doing. Yep, you guessed it, drinking more Pacifico. After this very hard day of relaxation I went back to my condo and slept like I have never slept before. I figure it must have been the beer that put me to sleep, :-). Oh, yeah I also did a suspended abs workout at some point. Too bad the beer eliminated all that work. Hopefully it helped balance it all out, hehe.</p>

    <a href='/images/photos/original/dsc_0052.jpg' target='_blank'><img align='left' src='/images/photos/medium/dsc_0052.jpg' /></a>
<p>Today I hiked to a set of falls known as Waipoo Falls. Waipoo Falls consists of both an upper and lower falls. These falls exist within beautiful Waimea Canyon. The trail to Waipoo Falls goes along the northern rim of the canyon. Along the way there exist a number short trails that lead to amazing viewpoints to take in Waimea Canyon in all of its glory. After following the canyon trails for about 1.2 miles I found the Waipoo Upper Falls. The water narrowed and fell a near 200 feet below into a small pool.</p>
<a href='/images/photos/original/dsc_0058.jpg' target='_blank'><img align='right' src='/images/photos/medium/dsc_0058.jpg' /></a>
<p>After absorbing the peace and tranquility of the upper falls I continued my hike to find the lower falls. I took the right fork which took me to the falls after hiking approximately 0.6 miles. Once, I arrived at the lower falls I decided that there had to be something beyond these amazing falls. So, I got a little bit wet and did a bit of rock climbing to get to the top of the falls and found that yet another trail existed behind the falls which followed an amazingly elegant stream for at least a 1/2 a mile. I then quickly turned around and went back to the lower falls to meet back up with the people I went hiking with.</p>
<a href='/images/photos/original/dsc_0068.jpg' target='_blank'><img align='left' src='/images/photos/medium/dsc_0068.jpg' /></a>
<p>After returning to the lower falls I started hiking back and got to the fork, this time I decided to take the Black Pipe trail back to the vehicle. It is basically a trail which goes the long way around and turns into switch backs going up the side of one if the mountains faces leading back to the original dirt road that went back to the car. At one point the Black Pipe trail looks to dead end, this was the point where the switch backs started. Due to the fact that the Black Pipe trail is a much less traveled trail the grass had over grown the path to the starts of the switch backs which is to the right of the trail end. All and all it was another amazing hike which was in total about 3.5 miles long.</p>

    <p>I woke up early today in L.A. and drove to L.A.X. to catch my flight to the beautiful island of Kauai. After finally boarding the plane and taking off I flew for about an hour, at which point the pilot came on the com system and notified us that there was a problem with one of the window seals in the pilots cabin. It was causing issues with being able to maintain cabin pressure so we then had to turn around and fly back to L.A.X. After making it back to L.A.X. the mechanics crew quickly, within 15 minutes, replaced the seal. Then, we waited about another 45 minutes for the clearance paper work to be filed so we could take off again and restart this venture to Kauai. Finally we took off again and flew non-stop to Kauai only 3 hours late! I arrived at Lihue airport and I couldn&#8217;t have been happier. The humidity and temperature were just right. I got a ride to where I was staying and relaxed the rest of the night after eating. The adventure begins!</p>
