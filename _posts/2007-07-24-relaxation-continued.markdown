Today, was yet another day of complete relaxation. All I did was mainly work on
a few side software projects that I have been messing around with. Beyond that,
I of course took in the amazing environment surrounding me. I also did some
exploration and research of Mac OS-X software. Specifically, I look at "Mac
Ports", "Fink", "TextMate", "Adium", and "Quicksilver". All of which look to be
amazing pieces of software. The reason I was investigating Mac OS-X software is
because I have a Mac Book Pro arriving shortly and I want to be able to get the
system into a usable fashion as quickly as possible. Later after dark, I went
to the pool and Jacuzzi and was told to get out of the Jacuzzi and pool because
the pool closes after dark. Lame, out of the years that I have been here
previously I have never seen the security people before. I have a feeling that
the same person that called and complained on me for drinking a beer at the
pool also called and complained about me being at the Jacuzzi after it was
closed. People like that are so stupid, I just don't get it. They really just
need to get a life. Anyways, enough of my rantings for the day. Tomorrow I am
going on yet another hike.
