  <section>
    <p>If you don&#8217;t know me there is one thing you should know about me. I love tools that help make things easier. Git has definitely been one of those tools for me. However, I always felt like there was something in the power of Git that wasn&#8217;t really being taken advantage of because of peoples past knowledge and training of centralized source control systems such as SVN. Git provides many advantages which are difficult to argue for an individual developers workflow. However, I am more interested in a solid workflow for a team that has very little overhead using Git.</p>

<p>The team of developers that I lead up for RealPractice just released our first Beta (still pretty alpha) of our product. Before this point in time I really hadn&#8217;t put in place a specific workflow largely because we had a small enough team that it was easily manageable and secondly because we simply had a huge amount of development before one release. Therefore, if things were broken during that period of time it was fine as long as what was in got fixed for the release. However, now that we have made the release I require a team workflow that gives us much more control of the development process, what gets included in the product, and at what stages things get included.</p>

<h3 id='centralized_branch_workflow'>Centralized Branch Workflow</h3>

<p>To begin with I looked heavily at a model that I have used in the past and seen used before. One of my developers Michael Genereux recommended this workflow as well when I told my team I was looking for a good workflow. However, I have only used this with very very small teams (2 man teams) in the past. Michael seemed to be a big supporter of this method so I discussed it with him and started playing with this workflow again.</p>

<p>This workflow uses Git in a centralized maner where you have an origin and that origin has branches for each of the stages/environments, experimental, development, qa, staging, and production. The idea is that development happens on the respective branches appropriately and gets merged backwards into the experimental so that it can follow the normal flow through the environments as one would want. In my mind this has a few major issues which are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Development occurs in upper level branches. Ideally even if you are writing a bug fix you want that bug fix to go through all of the stages starting at the beginning. One could argue that you could develop the bug fix in the experimental branch and merge it into development branch and so on. However, this leads to the second issue.</li>

<li>This model works fine if you have a very small team that is extremely good at managing and knowing their commit history because when a change is made to experimental it somehow needs to get put into the development branch. Some would say you simply need to merge it into development branch. This argument is fine if you are a single dev and develop in a linear fashion on the experimental branch. However, if there is a team of people all sharing the same experimental branch then it can be a pain in the ass to identify which commits belong to bug fix Y or feature X and need to be cherry-picked into the next branch.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can probably see from above points alone, managing the code base and what gets included in it can be very hard and consume an insane amount of time. Especially, if you have to go through and isolate commits that need to be cherry-picked into the next branch all the time. Plus, think about the fact that I am only talking about one level experimental to development. This same process has to occur at every level of the process experimental all the way through production.</p>

<h3 id='github_to_the_rescue_pull_requests'>GitHub to the Rescue (Pull Requests)</h3>

<p>So after playing with the above a bit more and thinking pretty heavily I decided there has to be a better way. I started thinking about how I develop and how I could commit code that would then go through the environmental pipeline appropriately and not have the same overhead. Thats when I realized that the biggest overhead in the above process is the fact that the devs have to isolate commits for cherry-picking all the time. Hence, I started looking for solution in the Git space and didn&#8217;t find anything directly within Git that seemed clean. Therefore, I started thinking about tools out side of Git and GitHub came to mind. With GitHub if you are using the pull based distributed model GitHub provides a feature called a &#8220;Pull Request&#8221;. This basically allows a developer to send a message to the upstream repository requesting that they pull in some changes. The beauty of the GitHub &#8220;Pull Request&#8221; is that it associates a range of commits with the pull request.</p>

<p>Hence, it allows a developer to develop a bug fix or feature in their repository and then simply create a &#8220;Pull Request&#8221; that includes the the proper commit range. Then when the upstream developer/integrator receives the &#8220;Pull Request&#8221; they can pull it into their repository and merge it in appropriately knowing exactly what the proper commit range is. This drastically reduces the amount of time needed to isolate the commits using the Centralized Branch Workflow. In my mind having the Pull Requests contain the commit range is brilliant on GitHub&#8217;s part because it is an unbelievable time savor. Plus they provide a web interface for testing conflict states of &#8220;Pull Requests&#8221; and merging them in as well as a communication mechanism to submiting the developers in case you have to deny a pull request.</p>

<h3 id='how_to_use_this_github_pull_request_model'>How to use this GitHub Pull Request Model</h3>

<p>The following is how I want my developers to use this model. In ones own local repository they should create a topic branch for every task, bug, etc. Generally the branches should be named with the id of the task or bug so that we can identify commits with bugs and tasks in history. This also eases the local workflow to allow me to switch a dev from one focus to another abruptly (I try to do this almost never, but sometimes it happens). Generally, a dev should be developing the bug fix, task, or feature and reach a point at which they believe that they have enough for me to pull their changes into the development branch. At that point they should create a &#8220;Pull Request&#8221; because GitHub will help them by figuring out the commit range. If they continue to develop past the point where they want me to pull and neglect to make the &#8220;Pull Request&#8221; until later then they will have to isolate the commit range they want me to pull using GitHub (which is still easier than just using Git by itself). Note that keeping each task, bug fix, etc in its own topic branch makes commit isolation much easier for developers.</p>

<p>Once, they have sent the pull request all integrators are notified of the pull request and then have the opportunity to pull the changes into the appropriate branch and move those changes up the pipeline as they see fit. Some developers see the act of making a pull request as overhead. However, they should note that it isn&#8217;t a side effect of GitHub it is a side effect of having to move change sets up the environment pipeline. GitHub just provides a tool that makes it easier than doing it without GitHub.</p>

<h3 id='moving_changes_up_the_pipeline'>Moving Changes up the Pipeline</h3>

<p>The last step in this process is the act of moving things up the environment pipeline. This is much the same process as in the Centralized Branch Workflow with one distinct difference, it is in a much more controlled environment because you don&#8217;t have all of your devs sharing the same branch space. Instead you as the integrator control the branch space. You may be asking, who cares? Well, I do for one because it makes moving changes up the pipeline much easier because it requires far far less cherry-picking. In fact the majority of the time all that is needed is to merge pull requests into development, merge development up the pipeline, and so on and so forth. Do note however that every once and a while you do need to cherry-pick but it is far and few in comparison with the Centralized Branch Workflow.</p>

<p>So this is the current workflow that I am going with. I haven&#8217;t completely decided on how much access I will give my team with respect to direct pushing if any. But, that is just a balance that has to be found over time in my experience. Anyways, I hope the above gives some insight into the workflow and why I have chosen it.</p>
