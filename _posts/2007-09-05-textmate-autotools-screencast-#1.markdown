I just threw together a screencast that covers a little TextMate Bundle I have
been working. The TextMate Autotools Bundle is an extension for the TextMate
editor which integrates TextMate with the standard GNU Autotools suite with a
specific emphasis on cross-platform building. Check it out below to see the
features and how to use them in this alpha version.
