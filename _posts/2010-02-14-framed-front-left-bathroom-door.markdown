This weekend my friend Dave and I framed in the extra door in the bathroom at
the front left of the house. It was the door that went from the bathroom to the
garage entry area that is going to become an in-door laundry area. We also
mounted a new 125 AMP Sub Panel in the framing as it is going to be the Sub
Panel that feeds all of the house that is rewired. Anyways, you can check it
