Well, tonight was another good night in the life of Drew. A combination of luck
and changing up my poker game won me a total of $220.00 after a $40.00 buy in.
It started off with a 12 player game which is a pretty packed game. Each player
bought it with a $20.00 and had the option of buying in a second time for
another $20.00. Luckily I chose to buy in again because the hands kept coming
my way after a little patients. Thats generally what poker is about in my
opinion. Being patient enough to wait till the time is right to make your
moves. Anyways, I very much enjoyed the game and night. I hope everyone else
did as well. Maybe you all will get lucky next time.
