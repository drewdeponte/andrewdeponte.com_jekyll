    <p>So, if you recall I few posts back I wrote about how I had run the new gas pipes for the new laundry room and the tankless water heater. I also pressure tested the system but found it was still dropping 1 to 2 10ths of a PSI in about 15 mins. This Saturday my goal was to go through and find the leaks in the branches one by one and fix them and retest.</p>

<p>I did exactly that, I pressurized the gas lines up to 100 PSI and soap tested and to my wonder none of the new piping I added had any leaks. So, I then started testing all the other branches. I found leaks in the Tanked Water Heater branch, Stove branch, Old Stove Branch, and the Furnace Branch. Hence, I took apart all of these branches and cleaned the joints and reconnected all of the piping and then re-pressurized the system to 100 PSI found no leaks in those branches. That took me about all day to get that much done. Then I did a 15 PSI test for 15 minutes as required to pass inspection and found that it was now dropping just 1 10th of a PSI in 15 mins. I was done for the day though and frustrated after spending the entire day fixing and testing leaks one by one.</p>

<p>Sunday I called my buddy Dave and had him come over at 9:00 am to help me accomplish my goal for Sunday which was to take all the gas piping out and put it all back in cleaning and fixing each of the joints. The reason this was my goal was because Saturday night when I was burnt out I did a 100 PSI soap test again and found a bunch of leaks up in the attic in the mainline. Luckily it ended up that whoever did the gas lines before wasn&#8217;t a complete idiot because they put a union right in the middle of the gas lines which allowed me to basically split the house in two halves and only have to redo one half on Sunday.</p>

<p>Dave and I redid the the kitchen half of the house on Sunday and soap tested and pressure tested it and all is good on that half of the house we are losing 0 PSI in all of pressure testing. That half covers the Tanked Water Heater, Stove, New Laundry Hookup, and Tankless Water Heater. Next weekend the plan is to finish the other half of the house which covers the Current Laundry, Fire Place, and Furnace.</p>

<p>Let the adventure continue, :-)</p>

    <p>Few, I just completed a very exhausting weekend with Aly and my parents. This weekend I ordered a dumpster because my parents were coming down to help work on my house and I had a massive pile of rubble in the backyard RV parking spot that needed to go. Once we loaded the dumpster with all of the rubble (more than two rooms of plaster) we decided to demo another room as the allocated 18 inches of heavy material at the bottom wasn&#8217;t filled. This was crucial in my opinion because that damn dumpster cost so much.</p>

<p>Once, we had completed the plaster portion of the dumpster loading my Dad and I went to finish running the new gas pipes to the tankless water heater and pressure test them while Aly and my Mom worked on the back yard patio. It took us all weekend to get the pipes in and pressure tested. There is still a small leak as it is dropping 2 10ths of a PSI in 15 mins. Hence, further pressure testing is needed to get to the required state of holding 15 PSI for 15 mins. We went through and tested all of the new joints numerous times but couldn&#8217;t find any leaks. Hence, we talked to some people we know in the industry and it seems that when you pressure test and find a leak you generally have to jack up the pressure pretty high 60 to 100 PSI and spray the entire joint not just the threading edges to find the leaks because some joints, elbows especially, tend to have pin holes due to imperfect manufacturing. We probably could have gotten this handled if it hadn&#8217;t been Mother&#8217;s Day on Sunday but it was nice to take a break and visit with family anyways.</p>

<p>Little did my Dad and I know, while we were hard at work on the black iron pipes, Aly and my Mom had done a huge amount of cleanup on in the backyard, started tilling the grass we previously killed, and removed most of the old nasty fiber glass patio cover. I was amazed with how much they managed to get done.</p>

<p>Thanks Girls!!</p>

<p>As usual I took pictures to let you all in on the progress. You can see them <a href='http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.535700310430.2048932.30901409&amp;type=3&amp;l=2a1476b7e5'>here</a>.</p>

<p>Oh, I also managed to replace the lighting boxes that were previously under the patio cover with outdoor boxes and light fixtures. Stay tuned for new developments with the house.</p>

    <p>Today, was a busy day as usual in the life of Drew. Aly and I woke up relatively early and decided that it was time to work on the backyard planter. It was in severe need of ripping out plants and weeding. So, Aly and I got our tools together and went to work cutting, chopping, digging, trimming, weeding, pruning, and jumping up and down in the natural waste garbage can, trying to get all of the stuff to fit.</p>

<p>It was quite involved as we removed the three largest bushes from the planter. These bushes had root systems like I have never seen before. Some of them went almost the entire length of the planter. Anyways, we did that till about 1:00 pm and then I started some more demo work behind the fridge for the gas pipes so that I could get a proper measurements before we went to Subway for lunch and then to, you guessed it, Home Depot.</p>

<p>Once we got to Home Depot we went and gathered all of the black iron pipe pieces we needed to get the gas piping done up to the laundry room. Beyond that we got some ground cover bark for the planter that we started working on. Once we got back Aly focused on picking the many river rocks out of the planter that the previous home owners put in there for some reason. While she was working on the planter I started working on notching out studs, drilling holes in studs and other framing so that I could run the pipe through the wall cavity in as few pieces as possible. As always the more connections you have the more possibility there is for leakage. Hence, I always try to get pipes done in the fewest number of joints.</p>

<p>It took us roughly till about 8:00 pm tonight to get the gas piping done up to the laundry room and get the planter decently cleaned out. You can see pictures of the results of our hard work <a href='http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.535700065920.2048929.30901409&amp;type=3&amp;l=240a1dad70'>here</a>.</p>
