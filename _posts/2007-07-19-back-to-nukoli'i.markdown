I deemed today, yet another day of relaxation. I spent most of the day once
again absorbing the peaceful atmosphere generated by the crashing of the waves
on Nukoli'i Beach. After, spending a few hours on Nukoli'i Beach I went back to
the condo and worked out for about an hour. I can't let myself get completely
out of shape because I am on vacation, come on! I then went and took a dip in
the pool and soaked in the Jacuzzi. After my dip and soak I came back to the
condo for some lunch and then ventured back out to Nukoli'i Beach to enjoy the
evening air take a casual stroll down the beach. On my walk I saw hundreds and
hundreds of sand crabs ducking and diving in and out of their little holes.
After, my lovely walk on the beach I went back to the condo and ate dinner and
relaxed some more, :-).
