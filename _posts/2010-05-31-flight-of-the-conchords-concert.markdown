Woot woot! Aly and I just got back from an awesome Flight of the Conchords
Concert at the Hollywood Bowl. I was very impressed with how they sounded live.
Their stage presence and performance in general is just amazing. When I think
about them, I always group them conceptually with parity bands. However, I
think the thing I love the most about them is their raw musical talent and
abilities to playing a vast number of genres really well while still doing
intelligent comedy. Anyways, I had a blast and I strongly recommend going to
see them live if you get the chance.
