Woot woot! Another substantial step in the process of my house has been made
today. The SoCal Gas Company came out and upgraded my Gas Meter to a higher BTU
rating to support my new Tankless water heater which some of you may have seen
pictures of in my Photo galleries. Anyways, I got a Noritz NR98-SV Natural Gas
Tankless Water Heater. It has a rating of 199,900 BTUs with a required with a
Natural Gas Supply Pressure of Min. 4" WC and a Max. 10.5" WC.

Anyways, my meter was upgraded today to support enough BTUs to supply the
Tankless Water Heater and the rest of the appliances in my house. SoCal Gas
simply sent out a tech to come in and assess the load of the appliances and
inspect that the appliances where all hooked up properly. After do the rough
calculations the tech replaced my meter with another Regulator and Meter that
would be substantial enough to supply all my appliances. She also increased the
sizing of the reducer immediately after the Meter outlet to what looks like a
3/4" minimum size rather than 1/2" like it used to be.

Anyways, I am one step closer, :-).
