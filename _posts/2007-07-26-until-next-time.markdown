Well, it has been an amazing stay on Kauai, "the garden island". Sadly now, it
is time to leave and go back to my normal (don't know about that) every day
life, :-). It is some what refreshing to back to life as I know it, yet sad to
leave this unbelievably relaxing place. Oh, well. I will be back soon enough,
:-). Until next time Kauai!
