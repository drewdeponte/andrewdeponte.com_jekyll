I recently released v0.3.12 of my CI server [OctopusCI](http://octopusci.com).
This release provided a feature which people have been asking for a while now.
I am glad to tell you all that it is finally here.
[OctopusCI](http://octopusci.com) now has the capability of re-running jobs
simply by clicking a link.
