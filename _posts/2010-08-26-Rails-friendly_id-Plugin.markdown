Hey all. I recently discovered the friendly_id plugin for Rails at a Orange
Country Ruby Group meetup. It basically provides a bunch of awesome
functionality with respect to permalinking and slugging. Anyways, I very much
recommend that you all check it out and play around with it. You can get to the
projects GitHub page [here](http://github.com/norman/friendly_id) and its
documentation [here](http://norman.github.com/friendly_id/).
