    <p>When I took over the software engineering team at my job. I had the opportunity to start fresh with a new ticketing, bug tracking, and project management toolset. Over, the years I have used a number of different tools most recently Trac and Lighthouse. However, I can go on and on with the tools that I have tried. When, I came on board they were currently using Jira which I know is big in certain communities, however, everyone seemed to hate it and I have a bunch of issues with it that I don&#8217;t want to get into. Anyways, so I spent some time and reviewed the following project management and ticketing systems again to just get a refresher and see where they were at and if any of them would work for me and my team.</p>

<ul>
<li>Redmine - <a href='http://www.redmine.org/'>http://www.redmine.org/</a></li>

<li>Basecamp - <a href='http://basecamphq.com/'>http://basecamphq.com/</a></li>

<li>Devalot - <a href='http://projects.noscience.net/devalot'>http://projects.noscience.net/devalot</a></li>

<li>ProjectPier - <a href='http://www.projectpier.org/'>http://www.projectpier.org/</a></li>

<li>Trac - <a href='http://trac.edgewall.org/'>http://trac.edgewall.org/</a></li>

<li>Jira - <a href='http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/'>http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/</a></li>

<li>Collabtive - <a href='http://collabtive.o-dyn.de/'>http://collabtive.o-dyn.de/</a></li>

<li>eGroupWare - <a href='http://www.egroupware.org/Home'>http://www.egroupware.org/Home</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So after heavy review of each of the above listed project management tools I decided on Redmine because it is hugely flexible, has a decent community behind it. It does have what I would consider some usability issues and some major design issues in the UI. However, once you learn those it is pretty much capable of everything I need it to do. When, you look at other solutions they all seem to be lacking very important features.</p>

    <p>Hey all. I know its been a while since my last post. But, life has been a little crazy. I recently took a position at a new company called <a href='http://realpractice.com'>RealPractice</a> heading up the software engineering team that is responsible for all of their new products. I am very excited to start up a new team and build some amazing software. I can&#8217;t wait to get started building a strong team that builds even stronger software.</p>

<p>I have a feeling that this will put a bit of a slow down into the progress on the house. But, this is what I love doing, so I think it is worth it. This may also for a temporary period of time also slow down my rate of posting with respect to software tid-bits. But, I will come back stronger than ever with more stuff to post about.</p>

    <p>After getting the 100 AMP Sub-Panel run last week as well as wiring two of the bedrooms and one bathroom I had one major bit left. Driving a ground rod and connecting it non-spliced to the cold water pipe and then to the main panel&#8217;s ground bus (or in my case neutral bus because it doesn&#8217;t have separate buses). I acquired the ground rod and some THHN 4 AWG to connect the ground rod to the main panel last weekend. So, today I woke up and since I decided that the best place to drive the ground rod was next to the gas meter I had to first dig out around the gas meter to find out where the gas main comes in. This was necessary so I didn&#8217;t accidentally drive the ground rod through it. So, once I dug for a while I finally found the gas main and followed it to make sure that where I wanted to put the ground rod wouldn&#8217;t effect the gas main. Luckily my original position was fine. So, then I started driving the 10ft copper clad rod into the ground with a sledge hammer such that a little less than a foot of the rod was exposed.</p>

<p>Once the rod was driven into the ground I then had to run the THHN 4 AWG from the rod to the cold water pipe and to the main panel. Getting the rod in the ground safely took me most of the day and was pretty damn exhausting. Running the THHN 4 AWG was a bit of a pain too just because I had to squeeze in by the eaves again. Anyways, I made a little update video clip showing what we did this week and last week with the electrical stuff. Check it out below.</p>

    <p>I just got back from an amazing vacation in Kauai. Aly and I went and just had an amazing time. We went hiking, kayaking, snorkeling, and more. This trip we made it one of our goals to try and find the best &#8220;Shave Ice&#8221; on the island. We definitely found some great &#8220;Shave Ice&#8221; at Jo Jo&#8217;s and a few other places but I am sure there is more to explore. The beauty of Kauai never ceases to amaze me. It is one place on the planet that I have found to be truly relaxing for me. Anyways, we took a bunch of pictures on the trip and I have posted them in the photos section of my site. The photos are split into separate albums titled by the event and preceded by &#8220;Kauai 2010&#8221;. For a quick way to get to the photos section just click <a href='http://www.facebook.com/andrewdeponte/photos'>here</a> and log into Facebook if you aren&#8217;t already.</p>

    <p>Well, I came back from my Kauai trip refreshed and ready to get some stuff done on the house. Today I worked with my Dad and Uncle to get the 100 AMP Sub-Panel run from the main panel with 2-3 Romex cable as well as rewire two of the bedrooms and one of the bathrooms. The 2-3 Romex is pretty expensive. I decided to get the 2-3 Romex rather than buying the individual conductors and conduit just because the price difference was relatively small and the 2-3 Romex is less work. Running the 2-3 was a bit of a pain given that the main panel is right were the eaves come down so I had to squeeze myself in real tight to get it run. But, I did it and now it is done. After a little exploration we also discovered that the main panel is only grounded to the cold water pipes in the attic which isn&#8217;t up to code. I am very happy with the progress we made and I will have to fix the grounding next weekend.</p>
