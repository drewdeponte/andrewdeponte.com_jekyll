As some of you may already know. I recently bought a 2 ft. White Lammi Pocket
Door for the front-left bedroom in my house. The reason I chose to replace the
hinged door with a pocket door is because the bathroom is a relatively small
bathroom and I want to make it as spacious as possible. I decided on White
Lammi Glass for a number of reasons.

1. You can't see through it so it provides some privacy in the bathroom.
2. It still allows light to go through it, and supposedly even intensifies the light that goes through it.
3. It has a more modern look and feel.

My buddy Dave and I started framing it into the wall last weekend but ran into
a bit of snag. We had managed to make the jam and the track square such that
the door closed properly. However, with the pocket frame as it came, the pocket
portion wouldn't sit parallel to the jam and square to the track. After,
calling some people that I know in the industry and talking to them for a while
they told me that generally the pocket door frames aren't squared 100% when you
get them. They said that this was due to a two main factors.

1. The pocket door frames aren't manufactured with enough precision.
2. The pocket door frames are tossed around when they are shipped and transported.

Anyways, after talking to these experts they basically told me that you have to
work the frame back into square. So, today my buddy Dave and I went back at the
frame and worked it and got it to finally be square with the help of a couple
shims, some body weight, and a light crow bar. We also had to shim the track up
on the back of the pocket side of the frame because the track part wouldn't sit
on the pocket when it was square with the door portion of the frame.

Anyways, installing this pocket door was a bit of a pain but now I know for
next time that I just need to force the frame into being square and tack it
into place. Plus, I think the finished result now that it is square is well
worth the effort. If you would like to see for yourself, check out the pics
