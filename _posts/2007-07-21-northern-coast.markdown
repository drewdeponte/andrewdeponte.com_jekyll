Today was yet another relaxation day. However, instead of spending it on the
east coast of Kauai like last time, I spent it at my normal condo on the north
coast of Kauai. It rained all of last night and today with some very strong
winds. Hence, I spent most of day inside relaxing, designing and writing
software, watching movies and TV, playing card games, etc. I did however at one
point during a small break in the weather catch a glimpse of the first rainbow
I have ever seen exist on the water rather than in the sky. Beyond that, I did
find out about the policy on the drinking at the pool and Jacuzzi. Basically,
there is no rule that states one can't drink at the pool. However, it is
required that drinks be kept in plastic cups as to protect against excessive
effort required to clean up broken glass in the Jacuzzi or pool. This rule
totally makes sense and is beyond acceptable in my opinion. So, in short, I can
continue drinking my beers at the pool or Jacuzzi. Thank God! I was really
worried for a second there, hehe, :-). Overall today was very nice and quite
relaxing.
