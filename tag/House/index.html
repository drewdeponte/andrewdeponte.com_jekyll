    <p>I know its a been a while since I made my last update about the progress on my house. I have been super busy with the house and a few other projects I have going on, not to mention my full time Job, :-). However, this weekend I manage to get quite a bit done. Probably, the most significant thing was the fact that I dug up over 4 inches of dirt for the entire backyard and put new soil down with furtilizer and laid some fresh sod down. My backyard actually is starting to look like a backyard. It feels so much better.</p>

<p>Secondly, I ripped out a wall, reframed it, and framed in another White Lami Pocket Door in the front bedroom. Hence, the closet now has a White Lami Pocket Door and so does the bathroom that is connected to the front bedroom. Seeing, the two White Lami doors hanging side by side helps me realize that my vision for this room is finally coming together.</p>

<p>Beyond, those feets I have been spending some time looking at fixtures for the bathroom that is attached to the front bedroom because the next step is really putting the plumbing for the fixtures in. Once, that is done I can drywall and tile the bathroom and the bedroom and put the fixtures in. Anyways, its coming together and I was definitely happy with the progress I made this weekend.</p>

    <p>Hey all,</p>

<p>I know it has been a while since I posted an updated on the house and I finally felt like I had a moment to breath tonight so I am going for it.</p>

<p>I was lucky that this year my family was doing Christmas at my Sister and her husbands house because it meant that my parents came out a bit early and they wanted to help with my house. So on the one day they came over, my Mom (I think of her as a master of mud) started cutting drywall to patch all the holes in the living room that I had to create to fix the gas lines and replace the electrical. While my Mom was doing that my Dad and I repiped the kitchen and got it hooked up to the new copper water system I put in the attic a little bit ago. My new dishwasher was delivered right around 7:00 pm so we called it a night.</p>

<p>The next day my Dad came over for a couple hours and we redid some of the electrical in the kitchen so that my new dishwasher would have electricity. After, that we installed my new garbage disposal and then install the new dishwasher. Oh, and when we repiped the kitchen we also ran cold water to the fridge which didn&#8217;t used to exist before so now I have a fridge that has water and can do cool things like make ice!</p>

<p>Once we stopped working it was time to clean up and get ready to go see some family for Christmas eave which was nice. I learned about a very interesting iPhone/iPad game called Osmos. It is a very interesting game centralized around a gravity simulation. Then today I woke up and went over to my Sisters house and spend time with her and her husband, their kids, my parents, and my sisters husbands parents. It was a nice to spend time with them. I feel like I have been so busy lately that I haven&#8217;t had a chance to see anyone except for people at work.</p>

<p>Plus its always nice to get presents, :-). This year was amazing I got clothes that I needed. Beyond that I got some other very practical things that I can use such as worm drive circular saw and a rolling tool chest. Anyways, thats my update I think next thing to tackle on the house is to repipe the laundry in the garage with copper. Once, that is done then I can repipe the existing bathroom, the one I am currently using, over a weekend. Once, those two things are done I will no longer be dependent on any galvanized water pipes and I can get rid of all of them, including the old tanked water heater which is still hooked up to them.</p>

<p>So, I hope you all had as nice of a Christmas as I did. I will try to post soon with another update on the house.</p>

    <p>So as some you already know I have been crazy busy with work as of late preparing for the launch of our new product. Hence, I haven&#8217;t had much time to work on the house. However, this weekend I finally had some time and decided it was time to break into the slab of the front shower so that I could replace the piping that connects to the drain and the piping that connects to the vent. The following video shows the results of this little adventure.</p>

    <p>I don&#8217;t know about your Mom, but my Mom always amazes me. Those of you who know me or follow my blogs know that about a year ago I bought a house and the backyard had two brick benches on the patio. The one thing they were missing was some nice bench covers. So, my Mom, being the amazing Mom that she is, decided she was going to make me some. So my Mom &amp; Aly went to the store and picked brought back samples of outdoor fabrics and I picked one.</p>

<p>A few weeks later my Mom called me and asked for the measurements of the benches and soon enough she brought me some amazing bench covers. Given that my parents live in Virginia when she came to visit she didn&#8217;t want to bring the foam for the covers with her so she had it shipped to me. Two days ago I got the foam and today I finally got around to finishing the cutting and installation of the foam. After, I finished I tried them out and they look amazing.</p>

<p>To check out some photos of them in their final state check them out <a href='http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.535708104810.2048945.30901409&amp;type=3&amp;l=1b5b6f0f43'>here</a>.</p>

    <p>Hey All, I know it has a been a while since I made a post on my progress with the house. But, that is because I have been crazy busy with me new job and have also been sick for a decent amount of that time. Anyways, my parents were visiting from Virginia this past weekend so my Dad came over to my house and helped me on Saturday and Sunday for bit with the copper repipe I recently started. Prior to my Dad getting here I ran all the copper for the cold water mainline in the attic up to the wall right before the new tankless water heater.</p>

<p>On Saturday and Sunday my Dad and I finished running the cold through that wall, connecting the cold to the tankless water heater, running the hot into the attic, and wiring the electrical for the tankless and connecting it. This leaves me with needing to finish running the hot mainline with the rest of the valves in the attic and then doing room drops as necessary for the new laundry room, kitchen, and bathroom. If you are interested in seeing you can checkout the clip below.</p>

    <p>After getting the 100 AMP Sub-Panel run last week as well as wiring two of the bedrooms and one bathroom I had one major bit left. Driving a ground rod and connecting it non-spliced to the cold water pipe and then to the main panel&#8217;s ground bus (or in my case neutral bus because it doesn&#8217;t have separate buses). I acquired the ground rod and some THHN 4 AWG to connect the ground rod to the main panel last weekend. So, today I woke up and since I decided that the best place to drive the ground rod was next to the gas meter I had to first dig out around the gas meter to find out where the gas main comes in. This was necessary so I didn&#8217;t accidentally drive the ground rod through it. So, once I dug for a while I finally found the gas main and followed it to make sure that where I wanted to put the ground rod wouldn&#8217;t effect the gas main. Luckily my original position was fine. So, then I started driving the 10ft copper clad rod into the ground with a sledge hammer such that a little less than a foot of the rod was exposed.</p>

<p>Once the rod was driven into the ground I then had to run the THHN 4 AWG from the rod to the cold water pipe and to the main panel. Getting the rod in the ground safely took me most of the day and was pretty damn exhausting. Running the THHN 4 AWG was a bit of a pain too just because I had to squeeze in by the eaves again. Anyways, I made a little update video clip showing what we did this week and last week with the electrical stuff. Check it out below.</p>

    <p>Well, I came back from my Kauai trip refreshed and ready to get some stuff done on the house. Today I worked with my Dad and Uncle to get the 100 AMP Sub-Panel run from the main panel with 2-3 Romex cable as well as rewire two of the bedrooms and one of the bathrooms. The 2-3 Romex is pretty expensive. I decided to get the 2-3 Romex rather than buying the individual conductors and conduit just because the price difference was relatively small and the 2-3 Romex is less work. Running the 2-3 was a bit of a pain given that the main panel is right were the eaves come down so I had to squeeze myself in real tight to get it run. But, I did it and now it is done. After a little exploration we also discovered that the main panel is only grounded to the cold water pipes in the attic which isn&#8217;t up to code. I am very happy with the progress we made and I will have to fix the grounding next weekend.</p>

    <p>So, if you recall I few posts back I wrote about how I had run the new gas pipes for the new laundry room and the tankless water heater. I also pressure tested the system but found it was still dropping 1 to 2 10ths of a PSI in about 15 mins. This Saturday my goal was to go through and find the leaks in the branches one by one and fix them and retest.</p>

<p>I did exactly that, I pressurized the gas lines up to 100 PSI and soap tested and to my wonder none of the new piping I added had any leaks. So, I then started testing all the other branches. I found leaks in the Tanked Water Heater branch, Stove branch, Old Stove Branch, and the Furnace Branch. Hence, I took apart all of these branches and cleaned the joints and reconnected all of the piping and then re-pressurized the system to 100 PSI found no leaks in those branches. That took me about all day to get that much done. Then I did a 15 PSI test for 15 minutes as required to pass inspection and found that it was now dropping just 1 10th of a PSI in 15 mins. I was done for the day though and frustrated after spending the entire day fixing and testing leaks one by one.</p>

<p>Sunday I called my buddy Dave and had him come over at 9:00 am to help me accomplish my goal for Sunday which was to take all the gas piping out and put it all back in cleaning and fixing each of the joints. The reason this was my goal was because Saturday night when I was burnt out I did a 100 PSI soap test again and found a bunch of leaks up in the attic in the mainline. Luckily it ended up that whoever did the gas lines before wasn&#8217;t a complete idiot because they put a union right in the middle of the gas lines which allowed me to basically split the house in two halves and only have to redo one half on Sunday.</p>

<p>Dave and I redid the the kitchen half of the house on Sunday and soap tested and pressure tested it and all is good on that half of the house we are losing 0 PSI in all of pressure testing. That half covers the Tanked Water Heater, Stove, New Laundry Hookup, and Tankless Water Heater. Next weekend the plan is to finish the other half of the house which covers the Current Laundry, Fire Place, and Furnace.</p>

<p>Let the adventure continue, :-)</p>

    <p>Few, I just completed a very exhausting weekend with Aly and my parents. This weekend I ordered a dumpster because my parents were coming down to help work on my house and I had a massive pile of rubble in the backyard RV parking spot that needed to go. Once we loaded the dumpster with all of the rubble (more than two rooms of plaster) we decided to demo another room as the allocated 18 inches of heavy material at the bottom wasn&#8217;t filled. This was crucial in my opinion because that damn dumpster cost so much.</p>

<p>Once, we had completed the plaster portion of the dumpster loading my Dad and I went to finish running the new gas pipes to the tankless water heater and pressure test them while Aly and my Mom worked on the back yard patio. It took us all weekend to get the pipes in and pressure tested. There is still a small leak as it is dropping 2 10ths of a PSI in 15 mins. Hence, further pressure testing is needed to get to the required state of holding 15 PSI for 15 mins. We went through and tested all of the new joints numerous times but couldn&#8217;t find any leaks. Hence, we talked to some people we know in the industry and it seems that when you pressure test and find a leak you generally have to jack up the pressure pretty high 60 to 100 PSI and spray the entire joint not just the threading edges to find the leaks because some joints, elbows especially, tend to have pin holes due to imperfect manufacturing. We probably could have gotten this handled if it hadn&#8217;t been Mother&#8217;s Day on Sunday but it was nice to take a break and visit with family anyways.</p>

<p>Little did my Dad and I know, while we were hard at work on the black iron pipes, Aly and my Mom had done a huge amount of cleanup on in the backyard, started tilling the grass we previously killed, and removed most of the old nasty fiber glass patio cover. I was amazed with how much they managed to get done.</p>

<p>Thanks Girls!!</p>

<p>As usual I took pictures to let you all in on the progress. You can see them <a href='http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.535700310430.2048932.30901409&amp;type=3&amp;l=2a1476b7e5'>here</a>.</p>

<p>Oh, I also managed to replace the lighting boxes that were previously under the patio cover with outdoor boxes and light fixtures. Stay tuned for new developments with the house.</p>

    <p>Today, I woke up and realized that yesterday we neglected to take the stump of the biggest of the three plants out of the planter. Therefore, I decided that I was going to remove the stump and all of its roots. After digging it and all of its roots out there was already a huge hole and a large portion of the planter had been dug up. During my Mom&#8217;s last visit she had mentioned that I should put a pond in the corner of the planter where this biggest bush previously resided.</p>

<p>So, after looking at the results of removing the bush Aly and I decided that we might as well just finish the job and dig a hole for the pond in the corner. Hence, I dug&#8230; and dug&#8230; and dug&#8230; for hours in the baking sun. Actually, it felt good to be doing some physical labor and the weather was pretty decent. Anyways, I dug it up and started the basics of the framing of the pond and its various tiers.</p>

<p>Check out the results of my effort <a href='http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.535700165720.2048930.30901409&amp;type=3&amp;l=f4316bf9ab'>here</a> in these wonderful photos taken by my love Aly.</p>

<p>P.S. - The finished part of the planter was all thanks to the hard work of my Mom during her last visit. Wench, I love you! Thanks for your help.</p>

    <p>Today, was a busy day as usual in the life of Drew. Aly and I woke up relatively early and decided that it was time to work on the backyard planter. It was in severe need of ripping out plants and weeding. So, Aly and I got our tools together and went to work cutting, chopping, digging, trimming, weeding, pruning, and jumping up and down in the natural waste garbage can, trying to get all of the stuff to fit.</p>

<p>It was quite involved as we removed the three largest bushes from the planter. These bushes had root systems like I have never seen before. Some of them went almost the entire length of the planter. Anyways, we did that till about 1:00 pm and then I started some more demo work behind the fridge for the gas pipes so that I could get a proper measurements before we went to Subway for lunch and then to, you guessed it, Home Depot.</p>

<p>Once we got to Home Depot we went and gathered all of the black iron pipe pieces we needed to get the gas piping done up to the laundry room. Beyond that we got some ground cover bark for the planter that we started working on. Once we got back Aly focused on picking the many river rocks out of the planter that the previous home owners put in there for some reason. While she was working on the planter I started working on notching out studs, drilling holes in studs and other framing so that I could run the pipe through the wall cavity in as few pieces as possible. As always the more connections you have the more possibility there is for leakage. Hence, I always try to get pipes done in the fewest number of joints.</p>

<p>It took us roughly till about 8:00 pm tonight to get the gas piping done up to the laundry room and get the planter decently cleaned out. You can see pictures of the results of our hard work <a href='http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.535700065920.2048929.30901409&amp;type=3&amp;l=240a1dad70'>here</a>.</p>

    <p>Today was the 3rd and final day of installation for this batch of windows which in total included 8 windows, one 4 pane 10 foot sliding glass door, framing a door way in, and doing all the stucco work. When C &amp; M Windows got here the day began with a bunch of prep work for doing detail work and stucco.</p>

<p>Once they performed all the prep work they did the finish work on the inside of the sliding glass doors. This consisted of ripping some small pieces of wood to account for the thickness of the plaster because the Milgard Sliders are sizes the standard width of a 2x4 and therefore require that you put filler in the gap to finish it. Once they cut &amp; installed all the pieces using a micro nailer they starting with the molding. By the way micro nailers are bitchin. I am going to have to acquire one at some point soon, :-). It was interesting to see them measure and cut the molding because they didn&#8217;t measure it. They simply placed the first piece and marked it according to the door frame. They then cut that piece and one end of the top piece, placed it, dry fitted it, and then marked it on the right side. They then proceeded to cut that piece and proceeded with the same process with the right piece. This technique produced a much better result than jobs I have seen done in the past where they simply measured.</p>

<p>Anyways once they finished installing the molding they caulked it and then moved on to anchoring the framed in door to the concrete and then began the stucco process. During my lunch break today they were kind enough to give me a quick course in stuccoing. It is very similar in technique and process to that of mudding which I have as of recent become pretty damn comfortable with. Anyways, they ended up doing the single coat of scratch &amp; brown coat combo to bring the stucco out pretty much even around the door. They mixed in roughly 1/3 rd Mortar Mix with the Quickreet scratch &amp; brown coat combo mix to increase the setting time to roughly 20 mins.</p>

<p>After finishing that they went and did the scratch coat on the area where they framed in the door. The scratch coat was the same mixture but they did it as a slightly thinner batch (more water) so that it would mix in with the lath better. Once that started to set a tiny bit they scratched it and went back to the door and cleaned up the stucco as it is much easier to clean up if you let it set a little bit because it won&#8217;t pull the stucco out when you edge it off. Anyways, they then went back and loaded and floated the brown coat on the framed in door and feathered it to blend it with the existing stucco. Once it was all even they let that set for a bit and started mixing the color coat which they had a chart that let them know what color coats to mix to produce the closest color stucco. Then they mixed that which was a much thinner batch compared to the scratch and brown. Beyond that, they did NOT mix in the mortar mix this time. They simply used the straight up color coat with some water as usual.</p>

<p>Anyways, they finished the color coats and cleaned up the stucco here and there after they let it set a bit and then did finishing touches on cleaning up the doors and removing the tap and cover from the slider as well as just doing general cleanup. And that was it, my doors were installed I wrote the check for the final payment and like magic I have amazing new windows and a slider and got a lesson in stucco.</p>

<p>Checkout the results <a href='http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.535699916220.2048928.30901409&amp;type=3&amp;l=354c6d171b'>here</a>.</p>

    <p>Today was yet another exciting day. C &amp; M Windows came back for the second day of my new windows installation. The plan for today was for them to get my new 10 foot 4 pane sliding door framed in and installed with the necessary weather proofing minus the stucco and finish work on the inside. The other object that they set out to complete today was framing in the side door to the area which is now going to become an indoor laundry room so that I don&#8217;t have go out to the garage to do laundry.</p>

<p>C &amp; M Windows managed to accomplish both of these tasks today within reasonable amount of time and were a pleasure to have around the house as usual. Last night when I was attempting to fall asleep it was amazing to notice the difference in the amount of sound now that all the new dual pane windows have been installed vs. the old single pane windows. Tonight, thus far has been even quieter as the sliding door has been installed. Beyond that the temperature difference between the house and the outside is much better now.</p>

<p>They worked on the slider framing and installation first and then proceeded to frame in the door and prep it with necessary moisture barriers and lath so that tomorrow they could mix the stucco and do the all the stucco in one session and finish work in one session. I can&#8217;t wait for tomorrow to come and to see the results of all this work and money.</p>

<p>If you are interested in seeing the results of today click <a href='http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.535699781490.2048927.30901409&amp;type=3&amp;l=19a3bc4d10'>here</a>. I included pictures of both new slider and the side door where you can see the flashing, moisture barrier, and the lath that will receive the scratch, brown, and color coat of stucco tomorrow.</p>

    <p>Hey Boys &amp; Girls, Today was definitely a very eventful day. Beyond the normal work stuff, like conference calls all day, one very interesting thing happened in my life today. Today, was Day 1 of the installation of my new Windows by a small company called C&amp;M Windows. As those of you that are close to me know, I am in a mode of supporting small businesses lately and C&amp;M Construction (I think they also DBA as C&amp;M Windows) is definitely one that is at the top of my list. I can not recommend them strongly enough for any Window or Door needs you might have. Anyways, they have very low overhead because they are such a small business so they can usually beat everyone else&#8217;s quotes. Beyond that they are just awesome people and do great work!</p>

<p>Anyways, I orded 8 Milgard windows and 1 sliding glass door through them and they came out today and installed the 8 windows. They got here a tad bit earlier than 9:00 am and and managed to get all 8 windows installed by roughly 3:00 pm. They are coming back tomorrow to do the installation of the sliding glass door and do a bit of framing work and stucco work for me. You can see the pictures of the 8 windows that were replaced today <a href='http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.535699377300.2048926.30901409&amp;type=3&amp;l=fa386bcc77'>here</a>. Beyond the windows you will see the slider that is going to be replaced tomorrow and the side door that is going to be framed in and stuccoed tomorrow. You will see the difference between the old and new believe me, :-).</p>

<p>Anyways, I am super excited that I have nice windows in my house now. It feels so much better already and there is more to come tomorrow. I am like a little kid on Christmas morning. Anyways, just figured I would share it with all of you.</p>

    <p>Woot woot! Another substantial step in the process of my house has been made today. The SoCal Gas Company came out and upgraded my Gas Meter to a higher BTU rating to support my new Tankless water heater which some of you may have seen pictures of in my Photo galleries. Anyways, I got a Noritz NR98-SV Natural Gas Tankless Water Heater. It has a rating of 199,900 BTUs with a required with a Natural Gas Supply Pressure of Min. 4&#8221; WC and a Max. 10.5&#8221; WC.</p>

<p>Anyways, my meter was upgraded today to support enough BTUs to supply the Tankless Water Heater and the rest of the appliances in my house. SoCal Gas simply sent out a tech to come in and assess the load of the appliances and inspect that the appliances where all hooked up properly. After do the rough calculations the tech replaced my meter with another Regulator and Meter that would be substantial enough to supply all my appliances. She also increased the sizing of the reducer immediately after the Meter outlet to what looks like a 3/4&#8221; minimum size rather than 1/2&#8221; like it used to be.</p>

<p>Anyways, I am one step closer, :-).</p>

  <section>
    <p>As some of you may already know. I recently bought a 2 ft. White Lammi Pocket Door for the front-left bedroom in my house. The reason I chose to replace the hinged door with a pocket door is because the bathroom is a relatively small bathroom and I want to make it as spacious as possible. I decided on White Lammi Glass for a number of reasons.</p>

<ol>
<li>You can&#8217;t see through it so it provides some privacy in the bathroom.</li>

<li>It still allows light to go through it, and supposedly even intensifies the light that goes through it.</li>

<li>It has a more modern look and feel.</li>
</ol>

<p>My buddy Dave and I started framing it into the wall last weekend but ran into a bit of snag. We had managed to make the jam and the track square such that the door closed properly. However, with the pocket frame as it came, the pocket portion wouldn&#8217;t sit parallel to the jam and square to the track. After, calling some people that I know in the industry and talking to them for a while they told me that generally the pocket door frames aren&#8217;t squared 100% when you get them. They said that this was due to a two main factors.</p>

<ol>
<li>The pocket door frames aren&#8217;t manufactured with enough precision.</li>

<li>The pocket door frames are tossed around when they are shipped and transported.</li>
</ol>

<p>Anyways, after talking to these experts they basically told me that you have to work the frame back into square. So, today my buddy Dave and I went back at the frame and worked it and got it to finally be square with the help of a couple shims, some body weight, and a light crow bar. We also had to shim the track up on the back of the pocket side of the frame because the track part wouldn&#8217;t sit on the pocket when it was square with the door portion of the frame.</p>

<p>Anyways, installing this pocket door was a bit of a pain but now I know for next time that I just need to force the frame into being square and tack it into place. Plus, I think the finished result now that it is square is well worth the effort.

    <p>This weekend my friend Dave and I framed in the extra door in the bathroom at the front left of the house. It was the door that went from the bathroom to the garage entry area that is going to become an in-door laundry area. We also mounted a new 125 AMP Sub Panel in the framing as it is going to be the Sub Panel that feeds all of the house that is rewired. Anyways, you can check it out <a href='http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.535699227600.2048925.30901409&amp;type=3&amp;l=46b03e486a'>here</a>.</p>

    <p>Few, the stress and hesitation is over with. Today, I closed on my first house. I am now a home owner. Can you believe that? I can&#8217;t. It hasn&#8217;t really settled in yet that I now own my own home. Now, the excitement and overwhelming feeling comes of the massive project that is a fixer upper house. However, with that also comes the great satisfaction and feeling of accomplishment after I make every addition step towards my goals for this house.</p>

<p>Everyone keeps telling me that the tasks around the house will never end. I am sure they are right, but that is also part of what I love about it. It continually evolves as technology and time progress just as any good software does. Beyond that, I now get to make sure that it is the way I want it. In fact the two primary factors I took into consideration while looking for houses were Location, Location, Location, Location and a good base (framing, foundation) to start from. Oh, and I of course had to consider the money part as well. Luckily I found a repo that needed a lot of work but had an awesome location and fell just within my budget.</p>

<p>Buying this house was a very difficult decision to make as I am currently involved in a number of side software projects besides my normal full time job. However, everything seemed to fall into place and it felt like the right time. So, after weeks and weeks of contemplation and discussion with friends and family I finally decided to take the leap, and here I am now a home owner. Oh the life!</p>
