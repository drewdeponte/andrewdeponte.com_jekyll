It has been a while since I have provided an update on my [Sublime Text 2 Guard
Plugin](http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard) and I just made some changes
so I figured I would make a quick post. The project has recently had a number
of contributions which I will list in the changes below.

* Fixed default Linux key-mappings
  ([#52](http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/52))

  ([#45](http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/45))

I have been completely stoked with the growing usage of this plugin as well as
the abundance of contributions people have been making to the plugin. In this
update there are a number of people that need to be called out with special thanks.

[@diogomafra](http://github.com/diogomafra) provided a *Clear output when
predefined text found* feature. I am sure many users will find this feature a
nice addition to smoothing out their workflow. Thank you for your contribution
[@diogomafra](http://github.com/diogomafra).

[@chrislerum](http://github.com/chrislerum) provided **rbenv support**. I know
that this feature will be huge for a number of the users as this was a highly
requestd feature.  Thank you so much for your contribution
[@chrislerum](http://github.com/chrislerum).

[@brandonblack](http://github.com/brandonblack) provided the ability to
function without bundler. This will allow users who aren't using bundler to be
able to use this plugin.  I think this is a great addition as the more people
we can get using this plugin the more feedback we can get. Hence, the better it
will become. Thanks for your contribution
[@brandonblack](http://github.com/brandonblack).

[@whitequark](http://github.com/whitequark) provided the basis for the **Run
all Tests & Show Guard Output** feature. I know a number of developers who have
been waiting for something like this to fit their personal workflow. Thank you
very much for your contribution [@whitequark](http://github.com/whitequark).

A big thanks goes out to all the above listed contributors and all of our prior contributors. Thank you all for helping make this a solid very useful plugin for the development community. As usual please make issues for any bugs or feature requsets you have at [Sublime Text 2 Guard Plugin](http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard).
