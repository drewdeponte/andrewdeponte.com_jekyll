After getting the 100 AMP Sub-Panel run last week as well as wiring two of the
bedrooms and one bathroom I had one major bit left. Driving a ground rod and
connecting it non-spliced to the cold water pipe and then to the main panel's
ground bus (or in my case neutral bus because it doesn't have separate buses).
I acquired the ground rod and some THHN 4 AWG to connect the ground rod to the
main panel last weekend. So, today I woke up and since I decided that the best
place to drive the ground rod was next to the gas meter I had to first dig out
around the gas meter to find out where the gas main comes in. This was
necessary so I didn't accidentally drive the ground rod through it. So, once I
dug for a while I finally found the gas main and followed it to make sure
that where I wanted to put the ground rod wouldn't effect the gas main. Luckily
my original position was fine. So, then I started driving the 10ft copper clad
rod into the ground with a sledge hammer such that a little less than a foot of
the rod was exposed.

Once the rod was driven into the ground I then had to run the THHN 4 AWG from
the rod to the cold water pipe and to the main panel. Getting the rod in the ground
safely took me most of the day and was pretty damn exhausting. Running the THHN
4 AWG was a bit of a pain too just because I had to squeeze in by the eaves
again. Anyways, I made a little update video clip showing what we did this
week and last week with the electrical stuff. Check it out below.
