    <p>Hey all,</p>

<p>My Sublime Text 2 Guard plugin has been out for a couple weeks now and it has definitely gotten some more usage under its belt. Thanks to everyone for your usage and feedback. As a result of the feedback and user generated issues I have released a new version to tighten it up a bit both from a user experience stand point as well as a stability standpoint. This release includes the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Now installable via <a href='http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control'>Package Control</a></li>

<li>Fixed Guard won&#8217;t start when installled via Package Control (<a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/11'>issue #11</a>)</li>

<li>Added auto show output feature (<a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues/12'>issue #12</a>)</li>

<li>Replaced <code>#!/bin/sh</code> with <code>#!/bin/bash</code> in internal scripts</li>
</ul>

<p>For info on how to get the latest version or how to report bugs, feature requsts, etc. Please check out the GitHub page for the <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard'>sublime_guard</a> project.</p>

    <p>Hey all,</p>

<p>I was having some difficulties with a couple bugs in the Sublime Text 2 Guard plugin I have been working on. So, I decided I would drop Jon Skinner, developer of Sublime Text 2, an e-mail and see if he knew about the issues I was having and hopefully of solutions/work arounds for them. Jon, was very helpful in terms of better understanding the issues as well as suggesting some work arounds.</p>

<p>Anyways, given the input from Jon I took another look at the bugs/features of the Guard plugin and decided to tackle them tonight. The following items show the progress that I made tonight with respect to the Sublime Text 2 Guard plugin:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enabled native Sublime Text 2 word wrap in the Guard output view.</li>

<li>Guard now exits properly when Sublime Text 2 exits/dies.</li>

<li>Added default key bindings to show Guard output view (super+shift+c)</li>

<li>Submitted a pull request to get the Guard plugin added to the <a href='http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control'>Package Control</a> repository list.</li>
</ul>

<p>As usual I am looking for feedback issues (feature requests, bug fixes, etc.) You can find the project as <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard'>sublime_guard</a> on GitHub. As of tonight I am down to two feature requests. So, please create bugs in the issues if you run into any so that I can work on fixing them sooner rather than later.</p>

    <p>Just dropping a quick note to all that follow my blog. Last night I made a numeber updates to the <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard'>Guard Plugin</a> for <a href='http://www.sublimetext.com/2'>Sublime Text 2</a>. Most of these were in direct response to feedback that I got from users after making the initial release on my blog, I think, two days ago. The modifications I made are enumarted below:</p>

<ul>
<li>The biggest addition is <code>RVM detection and integration</code>. The plugin is now intelligent enough to detect if you have RVM installed and detect if you are using a Project specific .rvmrc and of course respond by calling Guard appropriately depending on the case.</li>

<li>Another relatively small fix is a <code>vertical only auto-scroll</code>. Before, if Guard output went to the right past the width of the pane it was auto-scrolling to the right and then bouncing back to the left at the next line. Now, it always scrolls down the left most column of the output basically making it auto-scroll vertically.</li>

<li>Third I added some output preprocessing that <code>strips out the Terminal Color
Codes</code> so that the output is a bit cleaner.</li>

<li>I also added a lot of <code>descriptive output and error handling and output</code> to let the user better know what is failing so they might be able to debug the situation a bit better.</li>
</ul>

<p>As always if you have any feedback (feature requests, bug reports, etc.) you can simply create an issue for the project at the projects <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard/issues'>GitHub Issues Page</a>.</p>

<p>If you are new to the <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard'>Guard Plugin</a> for <a href='http://www.sublimetext.com/2'>Sublime Text 2</a> you can find installation instructions and document on the <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard'>GitHub Page</a>.</p>

<p>For instructions on upgrading please checkout the <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard'>GitHub Page</a>.</p>

    <p>Hi all. I know it has been a while. Please forgive me. My life has been a little crazy. I am still in the process of buliding my house. I also recently became engaged so I am trying to deal with wedding planning. Beyond that I am still trying to get all my development work done for RealPractice, my side company, and all of my open source projects.</p>

<p>Anyways, I needed a break from serious projects and decided it was time for a small fun project that would potentially help me develop the more serious projects more efficiently. A while back I started using a new text editor called <a href='http://www.sublimetext.com/2'>Sublime Text 2</a>. Basically it is what TextMate 2 promised (and failed) to be and more.</p>

<p>So, since I have been using this for a while and I have been developing Ruby and Rails apps lately using BDD and TDD I decided it was time to remove the annoyance of having to switch to the terminal after each little development iteration to check Guard&#8217;s output to see why my tests are failing. Wow that was a run on sentence. Oh, well it is 2 am and I just finished the plugin so bare with me. Anyways. Therefore, I decided it was the perfect opportunity to build a <a href='http://www.sublimetext.com/2'>Sublime Text 2</a> plugin that integrates Guard into it.</p>

<p>It is available with its documentation on GitHub at <a href='http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard'>http://github.com/cyphactor/sublime_guard</a>. Please don&#8217;t hesitate to go grab it, use it, extend it, contribute back, report bugs, or throw me new feature requests.</p>

    <p>I know its a been a while since I made my last update about the progress on my house. I have been super busy with the house and a few other projects I have going on, not to mention my full time Job, :-). However, this weekend I manage to get quite a bit done. Probably, the most significant thing was the fact that I dug up over 4 inches of dirt for the entire backyard and put new soil down with furtilizer and laid some fresh sod down. My backyard actually is starting to look like a backyard. It feels so much better.</p>

<p>Secondly, I ripped out a wall, reframed it, and framed in another White Lami Pocket Door in the front bedroom. Hence, the closet now has a White Lami Pocket Door and so does the bathroom that is connected to the front bedroom. Seeing, the two White Lami doors hanging side by side helps me realize that my vision for this room is finally coming together.</p>

<p>Beyond, those feets I have been spending some time looking at fixtures for the bathroom that is attached to the front bedroom because the next step is really putting the plumbing for the fixtures in. Once, that is done I can drywall and tile the bathroom and the bedroom and put the fixtures in. Anyways, its coming together and I was definitely happy with the progress I made this weekend.</p>

<p>If you are interested in a short video update from me on this weekend please check it out below.</p>
